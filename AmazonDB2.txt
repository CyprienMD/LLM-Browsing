I originally bought the MS 4000 which is very similar to this mouse except two features, 1) it has a tiny button on the left side of the mouse which I never used and 2) the mouse wheel glides. I found the gliding decent but sometimes it would glide by itself or after I finishing scrolling and I found it somewhat annoying.This mouse has a clicking scroll wheel, I thought it was going to be more like the MS 2000 mouse but the clicking is more defined. It is what I wanted but I wish it wasn't such a hard click. The MS 2000 mouse I found too heavy because it needs 2 AA batteries.Wish the scroll wheel was more subtle.EDIT: Though still not as subtle as the MS 2000, it has become less defined with age and still use it daily..

I honestly blame DK for the demise of that drive. It lasted 4 years, and WD replaced it under warranty w/o hassle. Keep in mind replacements are refurb and have a short warranty. Wouldn't be good if they didn't have better warranty that almost anyone in the first place. And they don't tend to fail in the first place.Performance is probably not the top of the hill, but they are faster than most and reliability is more important to me than ultimate performance.I only buy these drives.

Zero problems with Win7 install.The only problem I have with the drive is how noisy it is, although I was prepared for this going in.  Despite being prepared, its probably a bit noisier than I expected.  As I understand the Caviar Black drives were designed with maximum speed in mind, rather than quiet operation.  This is definitely the loudest hard drive I've ever owned, you can clearly hear the seek noise over my systen fans.  I got used to it after a week or so and to be honest I don't really notice it anymore, but for those that are OCD about overall system noise, you might want to go for the Caviar Blue or Green which are supposedly quieter drives.  The seek noise on this drive is bound to drive this type of person crazy.For me the noise level is not enough of a problem to take a star away.

The one drive I did have go bad was an external drive, and it was due to a cracked solder joint at the plug. It was a refurbished drive, but two years later they honored their warranty and sent me a brand new, bigger drive.

In fact I've never owned anything but WD hard drives (from 4.3gig to 1TB). In all my years of using them I've only had 2 go bad, though they never "completely" failed.  This speaks of Western Digital's consistency in reliability.With that said I love the Caviar Blacks and have 3 of them in my system - 500, 750, and now the new 1TB SATA 3 (64Meg cache).While there is a noticeable speed gain over my previous 1TB Caviar Black (32Meg), the previous version was/is extremely quiet!  This new SATA 3 drive is LOUD! It sounds like a percolating coffee pot at its highest boiling point, especially during boot-up or accessing files. Very annoying, especially if it's the noisiest part of your system!I just put an i7 system in a Cooler Master HAF X case which has 4 fans - 1 Front bottom 230mm 700RPM 19dBA (Red LED), 1 Top 200mm 7000RPM 19dBA, 1 Rear 140mm 1200RPM 19dBA. My Noctua CPU cooler fan tops out at 1200RPM load at 19dBA as well.  At idle my ATI 4890 video card fan runs around 27 percent, making it in-audible above the other fans.My point.... My case is extremely quiet.... Save for WD's new Caviar Black SATA 3 HD!!! Because of this I'm seriously considering going back to my previous 1TB 32meg cache Caviar Black HD.BTW this is a replacement drive as I thought the first drive was faulty due to the same noise. With that  I called Western Digital about this issue....  and to make a long story short, they say this is normal and that drive wasn't designed with noise in mind, that if you want a "quieter" drive, get the Caviar Blue.Make of that what you will....All I know is that the older 32mge cache Caviar Black drives ARE quieter than their 64meg cache cousins.Those looking for quieter WD drives might consider looking elsewhere (Blue or Green series) if noise is a factor over speed.4 stars.Edit. Went back to my previous drive because of the noise. If you want a caviar black that's quiet, go with the 1FALS (32meg) vs the 2FAEX (64meg).

I did not realize it was damaged until I pulled it off the shelf to use it a month or so later. As a result I was not sure which vendor it even came from. The 30-day return policy had expired, so I had to deal with the manufacturer WD. They turned around and sent me a reconditioned WD 1.0 TB Blue drive, which is totally useless to me. I can't resell a reconditioned hard drive!I had a similar 1TB blue drive that I put into my old XP test system back in January to replace a 6-year old Seagate drive. Well the WD Blue drive just died in September. So yet another drive I had to RMA. I don't know what is going on with WD, but their quality seems to be in the toilet lately. Maybe these are some of the drives that got wet when their factory got flooded a year or so ago. Seagate can't brag either because their drives are just as bad. I can't ever recall having to RMA so many new hard drives in one year. Samsung, don't even go there.I have built my business over the years by using better grade parts versus what my customers can buy in a ready-made PC from Dell, or at the local computer, or warehouse store. Installing hard drives with a 5-year warranty is one of those items I use to differentiate my custom built systems from the larger competition.So basically I lost over hundred dollars on this one hard drive when you factor in the return shipping costs and time spent packaging it up and dropping it off at UPS.To be fair to WD, generally they make a decent hard drive, especially with the WD black drives. I think a lot of the blame goes to the suppliers who buy OEM drives by the case, then don't bother to package them properly for shipping to the end user.I will not be buying any more hard drives from Amazon.

This time, even though this is a big drive, I went with caviar black because I wanted to make sure I'd get reasonable read times for video editing etc.  That's because I am moving my pictures/video/etc. here from my main hard drive where I wanted to ensure plenty of free space for windows/games/programs.The price was definitely affordable for this much space and for the quality product, so I'd say the value was excellent.The packaging was just fine, an outer box containing a small inner box that had the hard drive wrapped in static protecting bag and nestled in two plastic end pieces suspending the item in the center of the volume.The condition was new as promised.I installed it in my cooler master cosmos 1000 case without any hiccups, luckily I had an extra SATA cable lying around as I had forgotten to order one.  Power cable and SATA cable snugly plugged in without a hitch.  The hard drive itself obviously fits the standard form factor/typical screw locations as advertised.  Powering from a Corsair CMPSU-850TX supply and hooking up to an MSI P55GD65 mobo.I have noticed zero noise, though my case is extremely well insulated.I have not opened it up to check on temperature, though without any overclocking or case crowding... I'm guessing there's no issue there.Sadly I don't have SATA III so I can't speak to anything like a max transfer rate...  But things seemed perfectly acceptable speed wise when I saved files onto the drive from the main hard drive.  I wasn't paying enough attention to give any further detail.  The other drive is a 500GB western digital caviar black drive (WD5001AALS).All in all, I'd say this was an excellent buy and would heartily recommend to others-.

In fact, it has the best padding of any compact camera case I've seen. The case also has a soft nylon interior that won't scratch your camera.o 2 Compartments1) The main compartment is big enough to hold most compact cameras.

My camera fits very snugly in the case with little room to spare.I reckon the maximum dimensions of a camera that will fit in this case with reasonable ease to be about 4 x 2.5 x 1.25. If you have a camera that exceeds these dimensions, you may want to consider getting a bigger case.2) The front compartment is big enough for 4 AA batteries. It has a mini pocket with room for a CF card, a couple of SD cards, or several microSD cards.o  Shoulder Strap / Belt LoopYou can carry the case by using the shoulder strap or belt loop. The shoulder strap can be easily attached to or detached from the case.o  Attractive Grey/Black DesignThe case is predominantly grey and black with a smidgen of light blue. The rubberized zipper tabs are black with light blue fringes. The trademark black and bright yellow Case Logic logo features prominently in front of the case.

Amazon considered this an Add -on and I was able to get a price reduction when I purchased it alongside a camera. It comes with a strap and can be worn around the wrist, neck or shoulder.

But I would definitely not recommend this to friends. Spend your $5 on a different trinket.Edit: Also found that the earbuds transmit external noise greatly.

Make sure you get a good seal when inserting the rubber tips in your ear canals though, or they will sound bad. A lot of people do not realize you have to experiment with all the different sizes of tips included so they fit snugly to block out ambient sound and keep the music blocked in.

If I were REALLY picky, I might say that the very high frequencies are a little muted. Bass is tight and solid, but not overly pumped. I actually like that - too many headphones are built for heavy bass all the time, but I don't only listen to bass-heavy music. That's what graphic equalizers are for. Due to the sound isolation, volume is great. You can pump it all the way up without getting any noticeable distortion!Very light and comfortable in the ear (it comes with three sizes of ear inserts, and I use the smallest), and I can listen for hours without discomfort. They are snug and do not fall out on their own, and the sound isolation is quite good. I can not hear people talking to me, even with the volume only around 30-40% on my Macbook or iPhone.If I HAD to nitpick, I'd say the only thing that could stand improvement here is the wire connecting the buds to the headphone adaptor. It's a pretty typical, plastic-coated double wire; not any worse than most budget headphones, but not any better. I would pay for an upgraded cable that won't easily fray or twist, and one that's maybe 6&#34; to 1' longer.Really, it's just a small complaint of mine, because I don't want to have to keep replacing these.

I have models of earbuds for 30 up to 150 bucks.  These are stunningly good.  I was going to add "for the money" but, "for the money" they are ridiculously good.  I don't know what the other companies and brands are spending to produce theirs but if you can make and sell at a profit earphones that sound this good for 7 bucks, most of the major companies are doing something wrong (or super right in terms of profits and brand name).  These are terrific.  The cord is kind of cheap and nothing to write home about, but no worse than that which comes with iPods.  But the sound is vastly better.No mic.  These are not for smart phone use for making calls, just for listening to music and movies and such.  They come with three sizes of the ear things.  A tight but comfortable fit in your ear canal is essential for this type of bud to sound right. The large ones work best for me on this model.EXCELLENT base response.  However, that tends to be true of all models like these IF you can get the ear sealing fit right and also comfortable.  Otherwise, balance and tonal quality is warmish but not mushy.  I'm stunned and impressed.  As someone else (younger than me said here, in the vernacular of the day, these are SICK.  As in, SICK = AMAZING for 7 bucks.  They beat anything I've tried ever under 80 bucks.  And my current fans at 80 bucks do not sound better--well maybe a tad ,but since I cannot do a blind listening test, I'm biased by knowing which were the expensive ones.  If you want this type of model of ear buds, these are terrific.  Just watch the volume levels since these seal your ear canal.  The potential for damage to your hearing is greater than headphones that sit over or one your ears, or the type of buds that fit more loosely in your outer ear canal (my all-time favorites of those types, by the way, happen to be a kind of Panasonic you just cannot get anymore. They came with these plastic mp3 players they used to sell.  Best sounding, open ear ear buds in history.  Really.  I bought a bunch of the cheapo mp3 players when they were going out of existence just to get enough of those open ear ones  to last me many many years (open ear ones are better for running, biking, working out, etc., where you need to also be able to hear what's going on around you.)  Anyway, panasonic likely understands something about earbuds other companies don't or don't want to act on (like a more powerful magnet maybe for the drivers?)Get these.  They are great.  And if you don't like them or can't get best sealing fit, you are out 7 bucks.  To trips to starbucks..

Otherwise, good mids and highs. Very comfortable, and excellent sound-isolation. Miles above comparably priced headphones.If there is a fault with these earbuds, I would say it's in the cord. It's very thin, twin stranded, and tangle-prone cord. It doesn't look very strong at all, and I suspect the cord will wear out relatively quickly. Still, if I can get at least 1 year out of these, I'll be very happy.As a side note, the thin cord of these buds actually reduce the microphonics.

They are about an inch long and 9/16" in diameter, so they of course allow firm tightening using only the fingers, being much easier to hold onto then the usual plain F connectors. But evidently the way the assembly fits to the cable is tight (which is good) so the connectors do not turn freely (as plain F connectors do), although not so hard as to be a problem.I like the center conductors of these TV cables to stick out quite a bit, so I can line it up with the hole it goes into before I start the outer screw on part. These were about even with the opening, which proved to be OK for finding the hole by feel, before starting the screw on part.The red plastic can slide forward a bit when you are pushing it while screwing the outer part on. This happened to me on one end and I needed pull it back to allow the end to be screwed on fully.The cable is rather pretty in a high-tech way, like quality items often are. Of course the cable performs just fine.It was even packed nicely, and not coiled over tightly, as cables often are, which makes them hard to get un-kinked..

Seemed a little cheap, but I went ahead and connected to my AV system.* First connector spun freely and connected quite easy with hand twisting. bigger grip size was a plus if using in small space.* Second Connector was stiff and did not spin freely around the cable.  If I had the time, I would have returned for a replacement or another cable.  As it stands, I worked the item onto my coaxial plug and it's pretty much there til I cut it off later on.  Because I can't get enough grip around the end to freely spin it around the Black cable sheath.  The plastic is pretty thin and eliminates the ability to use a tool to tighten or loosen the connector without destroying the connector.Bottom line, Like the cable, hate the connectors.  They are " CHEAP THIN PLASTIC " as shown in some of the extra photos on Amazon product page.  Easy grip connectors are great in theory, but the inferior cheap thin plastic connector is a FAIL.  For the same price, I'd go with another Belkin cable which I used in the past.  The Belkin is more flexible cable, and the connector is truly a premium design with easy spin metal connectors.Pass on this one.

The connectors are solidly attached at the ends.  You should only use as much cable as you need, because added cable length attenuates the signal, but this is low loss cable and the difference between 25' of cable and 50' of cable probably won't be significant.For outside applications, protect all connections from water, as any water (even humidity) that can make it into the connection will cause corrosion, which is a major source of signal loss.  I'd recommend wrapping the sticky rubbery silicone tape that sticks to itself over the connection, sliding heat shrink tubing over that and shrinking it to keep out water.  When possible, install connections under eves where they are protected from rain, snow and ice.The blue molded plastic grips on the end connectors allow this cable to be installed by hand, which can be very handy when making blind connections on the back of the TV as it's hanging on a wall mount (detaching the lower portion of the TV from the wall mount and hinging it out from the top helps to make enough clearance), but there is a down side to the plastic connector grips.  You'll need to drill a large 9/16&#34; hole in the side of your house if you're running this cable outside to connect to an external antenna.I used this cable to connect a large roof mounted 3'X4' DB8e UHF antenna directly to our Samsung 32&#34; LED TV without using an inline amplifier, and we're picking up strong signals from HDTV stations almost 90 miles away.  We get 35 channels of over-the-air HDTV, with no cable bill.I ordered the TV, BluRay/DVD player, coax, antenna mount and antenna from Amazon and it all worked great together.  Great price, great value, great convenience.  I love shopping on Amazon and having the stuff I want in a couple of days, delivered directly to my door.  I don't even watch TV.  That's my wife.

I refurb JAPANESE MICRO sets from the 60-70's and specialize in adapting to current Digital use. I use a lot of patch cables. On this project, I was converting a Sinclair 2&#34; TV from 1978 that was found brand new in storage, with a ATSC /mh decoder. This short length cable was just what I needed. The flexibility made it's placement easier. The connectors are superior. ATSC decoders and analog sets do have interference problems which can sometimes be minimized by good cable shielding. The shielding was fine. However, I still had interference from a 5v iPad charger. I believe at this point that the interference actually was affecting the tv at a short 2&#34; of exposed twin lead. I had to use a matching 75to300 ohm adapter. So, when you buy cable, get the best shielded jackets, best connectors you can afford and expect reception problems even with DTV.

Reception on the old antenna was bad and getting worse (stations of interest are 60-80 miles away), and I wanted to try an outdoor antenna, but I was unsure how far away from the TV and how far up I'd need to go, so I figured a 50 ft. run would cover quite a number of options. I was concerned because, with the old antenna, I'd often need to stand next to it or even hold it at a certain angle to get reception on bad-weather days, and so was concerned that a long run of cable would be a liability.ANYWAY.... the setup works BRILLIANTLY. With the new antenna, even with the long cable run, I pick up a dozen or so more channels OTA, and it works so well I haven't even taken the antenna outside yet! (I will soon, it's UUUUUUGLY inside!) The length of the cable seems to have made no difference, since the rec'd signal is strong and clear on most channels. Currently, the antenna is mounted nearly touching the TV - I could have used a 6 foot cable instead. BUT, I am planning to try it outside, so the extra length will be useful.Only minor nit with this cable is that it comes with a gripper-sleeve around the connection. They should have called it a "SLIPPERY_SLEEVE" instead. The hexnut on the cable is much easier to hold; I couldn't grab the sleeve firmly enough to install the cable to the TV or antenna. But - good news - it comes off easily!Excellent cable with little apparent attenuation over its length. BTW, the antenna that works so well is by Clearstream, this one: Antennas Direct C2-V-CJM ClearStream 2-V Long Range UHF/VHF Indoor/Outdoor DTV Antenna with 20-Inch Mount.Ken - Author of "The Pellet Stove Almanack: Home Heating Joins the 21st Century" - world's first consumer book on wood pellet stoves..

Its wonderfully compact and the speed feels comfortably fast on my older system.That said, it was not easy to set up, but Edimax Customer Support was very helpful. I think the ease of setup has a great deal to do with your wireless router and the router's software. At the time of purchase, I had a Linksys E3000 router. I hate that router (and I used to LOVE Linksys routers! The hardware was very serviceable, but the software was abysmal!)!I purchased this adapter for an old Mac 1.6GHz PowerPC G5, running Mac OS 10.5.8 (Leopard), which did not have built in WiFi. I use this system for older applications that I still need access to (or for when my kids need internet access).I downloaded the software from the Edimax site. Setup went smoothly. The Edimax Wireless Network Utility must run in the background to allow wireless access like other wireless adapter of this type. The Edimax Network Utility showed I was connected to my wireless network with my Linksys E3000 wireless router. However, the E3000 required a static IP address and completely manual setup to get a connection to the internet.When that router (Linksys E3000) recently died, I replaced it with an Apple Time Capsule. Once I started up the Network Utility, I easily connected to the network. Next I deleted my old Network Adapter profile in Network Settings and set up a new one, entering the DNS server and Search Domain addresses. My IP address was immediately supplied by DHCP and I had my internet connection.During use I found that I while can set up the Utility to startup when the system does, I must sign on to the network each time to get network access. The network password does not appear to be saved. With the E3000 this process usually took MANY attempts, over as much as 30 minutes time. Adding devices with the E3000 was alway a chore. With the Time Capsule, connection was immediate. It may be possible to set the Network Utility to auto-connect to the internet, but I have not been successful.Use of this adapter is much easier with the Time Capsule. I just start the Network Utility, select the profile and click &#34;apply&#34;. Enter the network password and click &#34;connect&#34;. I then can hide the Utility and use whichever browser or access network drives as I desire. When I finish network activity I quit the Network Utility.There is one really odd thing I noticed which is why I gave this router 4 stars instead of 5 and why I quit the Network Utility immediately after use. I was working at my main station in my office while one of my kids left the G5 on and walked away without shutting down (again!). After a while, I hear a sound that started low and increased and increased in volume until it sounds like there is a jet plan in the office with me! It was the fan on the G5! I couldn't make it stop or shut the system down normally. I had to literally pull the plug.As it happens with my kids, they forgot to shut down on other occasions. If they were simply using Word or Powerpoint, no fan. If they browsing the internet... jet plane. I realized that if the Network Utility was left running while not in use, and the computer went to sleep, the G5's fan would kick on with ever increasing speed. Weird! If the computer was left on and the Network Utility was off, this did not occur. While I have not tried to repeat the jet plane/fan experience since installing the Time Capsule, I don't need to. I never let the G5 go to sleep with the Edimax Network Utility on.I believe there is a software issue here. I had a Netgear Wireless G54 Adapter prior to this. It worked poorly on the rare occasions that it worked, but its software never turned my system into a jet plane. This adapter WORKS even if there is a bug and the workaround is simple - just don't be lazy, turn the software off when not in use. For the price, I'm very satisfied..

As I did not want to spend a lot of money on an older machine I stumble a crossed this on Amazon Prime for 10 dollars. The description said it's support by Linux so I gave it a try, as well all know supported by Linux normally means finding some third party drivers and installing it your self.To my surprise I plug it in powered on my machine and 3 minutes later it was up and ruining, the drivers were natively supported. The only issue is I have 22Mb of "Comcast bandwidth" and I normally get only 5-6Mb of through put on this card. Again it's good for what I need YouTube is a bit slow in HD and Netflix (on windows with this card) works well. I've not tested other windows stuff with it yet but Win 8 recognized it in under 1 min. The range is as to be expected on such a small device but it's good enough for me to do what I need at home. It does connect to Starbucks internet while I am enjoying a Coffee drink quite well and supports the latest standards for encryption. If you are in need of a cheap fix this is IT!

For file storage or file transfers Class 2 chips are fine, but I would not use Class 2 cards on newer devices that require a faster SD or microSD card.Bottom line first: I have some of these cards (bought because of the price and even I can't resist a good deal on cheap storage), but also Class 4, 6, and 10 chips. (In fact, my review of this chip is based on owning about 300 chips (or cards if you prefer and using chips back in the days when 2 MB chips were $90, yes, I said "megabyte" :)The caution you have to take is that if you are getting these chips as a primary or principal card, keep in mind that its speed rating may be insufficient for use on SOME of your devices. (E.g., some cell phone camcorders record video fine, others require a faster chip, such as Class 4 or 6).Details:An SDHC's "Class" rating is its performance based on how fast the chip can transfer digital information on or off the chip. Why is this important?In layman's terms some Class 2 chips are too slow, on some devices.  Basically, Class 2 SDHC chips (even brands brand name cards) cannot record/transfer modern-day HD video digital information fast enough.  Your video will record with lag and play with lag ("lag" means delay or choppiness).Transfer rates (sometimes called "speed ratings") for the current chips are:Class 2 = 2 MB per second file or digital information transfer speed.Class 4 = 4 MB per second.Class 6 = 6 MB per second.Class 10 = 10 MB per second.Interesting: Until recently most chips have had the Class rating imprinted on the label.  It's the letter "C" with a number 2, 4, 6, 10 inside the C loop. Also until recently it was only chips from questionable manufacturers who did not identify the chips speed rating on the label (because those chips were typically low speed Class 2 chips).  That's why it's not cool for SanDisk to be doing this, hiding the fact that a chip is Class 2. (Of course SanDisk is simply doing what its customers want, providing a high capacity chip at the lowest possible price.)Sidenote: Some device manuals will warn about the minimum Class (speed) a chip/card should be, some manufacturers do not clearly disclose chip speed requirement for video recording/playback.Pricing: Generally the faster the chip the more expensive it will be. If a card is 16GB for $20, that's usually a hint that it is a Class 2 or 4. As you may have correctly assumed, brand name cards with high capacity (32 GB), Class 6 and 10, from a reputable seller are going to be way more expensive than chips with one or all of these factors missing. That old saying applies here: "you get what you pay for."And no offense to people, but if you think that because a chip is 32 GB and says "SanDisk" on it, that the card must be good, well, that makes as much sense as thinking  $100 digital camera must be good because it has "12 Mega Pixels" emblazoned on the front.Bonus Tip: On eBay there's thousands of sellers in China selling counterfeit chips (estimates are that 90% of eBay chips are counterfeit.  Chips that are labeled SanDisk when they are not, Class 6 when really Class 2, etc.)So I would buy chips from an established seller on Amazon, someone who sells only chips and has been doing so for a long time, and who has great reviews, or buy from your local retailer.  More expensive, for sure, but that's better than the 90% chance you will be getting a fake chip on eBay.If you do buy on eBay, NEVER buy chips from Hong Kong sellers, including the ones who post a fake U.S. address. A hint that something is amiss is to ask yourself how a Hong Kong seller can list on eBay cards for 1/10th the price that U.S. online sellers require to purchase the supposed same chip. (And remember that the Chinese sellers are very good at making the fake product look like the real thing.)Bonus Tip: The "HC" in "SDHC" has nothing to do with speed.  The "HC" designation came out when chips went over 2GB.  It stands for "high capacity."Bonus Tip: Class 2 chips will in fact record video. On older devices a 2GB chip was state of the art at the time, so in 2009, for example, a phone or camcorder will record quite well using Class 2 chips. But in these days of 720p and 1080p true HD recording, even on cell phones, a Class 2 chip may not do.  (Note: some manufacturers include a warning on the device, including in the video troubleshooting section, that a chip may be too slow for some recording settings).The way you will find out that you needed a Class 4, 6, or 10 MB/s chip is when you play the video.  It will be choppy (and some videos won't even play).If you get poor playback, the culprit is usually the Class 2 chip. (Also, poor playback can happen if you are playing the video on your PC directly from the chip, that is, rather than transferring the file to your PC then playing it from there. If the chip is too slow, simply transfer the file to your PC then play the video.)Bonus Tip:  Ideally always buy Class 4 or greater chips. More expensive, yes, but the performance can range from better to outstanding.  Plus while any chip can transfer files from the chip on to the computer, the higher speed chips transfer files a lot faster. That's a huge benefit when transferring HD video, that can get up to 4GB in size.Note: Ever wonder why some devices limit the length of your video, say to 10 minutes? That's because the device cannot handle large files and/or the chip may be too slow to work with files 2GB or larger. Easiest workaround for device manufacturers, limit the length of your video..

If you receive a "genuine" SanDisk 32GB microSDHC, then everything is fine. I ordered this item twice. The first time from a company (GO-DPS) that sent me a memory card that looked real with the correct imprinting - SanDisk 32GB class 4 in a plastic case with no exterior packaging. It seemed to work. I loaded the contents from my old 16gb card into it. Then I noticed that a lot of the apps were missing. I thought that I just couldn't copy everything to a new card and so redownloaded the apps. Then I noticed music missing. Some was there, most was gone. I realized that the card only could hold 2gb of data. I refomatted it with both the windows formatter and the SDformatter. Both formatters seemed to work without problem - everything said 32gb, but each time the card could only hold 2gb. I complained and received a prompt refund from GO-DPS.I purchased another card from the same page, but a different vendor (Blue Proton) and this one works great so far. It came with original retail packaging (just the microSDHC card, no SD adapter card). Now I use the old 16gb in an adapter with a digital camera.I don't know if the first memory card was a deliberate fraud - imprinting a high capacity and fake brand name on a substandard capacity memory card - or a manufacturing defect, but it wasted time, although fortunately no money - yet. The company was supposed to send an RMA with postage, but they never did. Since I received the refund, I'm in no hurry to send it back and certainly not without a RMA number.I had purchased from Blue Proton before and was satisfied. I didn't take advantage of the free offers because I read reviews saying that they added S/H and the checkout seemed to indicate added charges, although when I purchased a few years ago I don't remember paying extra for the bonus items. I don't know what the story is. Regardless, the bonus items are not of much value to me, so I didn't want to take the chance of paying extra for unneeded stuff..

I spent a couple of hours trying to guess how to install all my devices and put one laptop on the 5 mhz channel. I finally had to call Motorola and the first thing they wanted was a credit card with a minimum of $30.00 just to start. To put a specific device on the 5 mhz channel it was even more money because that was a new issue.Once I got everything hooked up I found the range was very disappointing and then after about an hour my speed went from 32 mbps down to 10 mbps. I rebooted and it was back to 32 and an hour later back to 10 and it did it again and again. To make sure it was not the cable I put the old 2.0 router back on which was not as fast along with a Medialink Wireless N router and it worked just fine with no sharp drop-off in speed. This unit is being sent back today.With that said I still think Motorola makes great products but if you want the fastest speeds out there you are going to have to get separate components. I am ordering the Motorola SB6121 3.0 modem with the Linksys Ev200 ( V2 ) router which is expensive but has the best speeds, best range, most features out there.I hope Motorola takes note and comes up with some easy installation software or at minimum some decent instructions for us average folks in the future..

However, I bought it on eBay from a person who specializes in refurbishing cable modems, for half the Amazon list price. I had absolutely no problems activating the modem with Time Warner or getting it to work, but I also have extensive hands-on experience with designing, installing, and maintaining computer networks.Here are some more tech-geek details about this modem:A heavy Xbox gamer who lives in my apartment building, across a courtyard, was extremely disappointed because all he could get on my Wi-Fi signal from this modem was a sad day of playing Call of Duty. The lag was so bad that every time he raised the gun to shoot his online enemies, he would get shot dead first. The Wi-Fi signal was strong enough for his grandmother to play an online bridge game with her iPod Touch, but her data usage is light duty compared to the heavy bandwidth demands of an Xbox gamer, who was only able to squeeze one bar of data off the same Wi-Fi signal.So this modem might not be worth buying if you are intending to roll out a Wi-Fi setup in a large house. The signal is weak, but everything else about this modem is fabulous. I've been clocking speeds as high as 120 MPBS with a direct connection, using a network cable plugged into the back of my computer. The Wi-Fi works fine inside the house (but at clocked speeds much slower than 100 MPBS), but once I go outside, the Wi-Fi signal immediately fades out on my iPhone.I will update this product review if anything changes. Also, if you have any questions about this modem, I might be able to answer them. My pre-buying research indicated that this is the luxury end of the market for cable modems, and the lower-priced Motorola Surfboards will actually be powerful enough to meet the needs of most people, but if you're a geek, this is the one to buy.Update: After reading other Amazon product reviews, I decided to disable the built-in Wi-Fi and use my own wireless router. So far, this has 1. increased the speed of my wired internet connection significantly, and 2. the Wi-Fi signal is much stronger and more reliable for the little guy across the hall who just wants to play Call of Duty on his Xbox.Update #2: This modem has been on and powered up nonstop for six months without having to be rebooted even one time.

Once I got everything plugged in I called Comcast to register it for use.  The extra time involved in this process turned out to be Comcast uploading the current firmware to the modem.  Once that was done, my hardwired desktop PC was online.  Then I followed the directions to log into the router through the IP address. I had searched and found a video on resetting the default password so that was no problem.[...] I checked the IP flood detection setting everyone else talked about and the default was already "disabled".

I just fired up the laptop, searched for available networks, entered the 16 digit code off the sticker on the modem, saved the connection and Boom-the laptop was online.Time will tell if I get the random resets others have complained about.

It would save me $13/month vs renting one from my cable provider Time Warner and be a next generation cable modem with very nice wireless speeds.I like a lot of others, ignored the bad reviews in light of some good reviews and rolled the dice on it.  My dice came up snake eyes.The modem would constantly disconnect from service, at least every couple of hours ranging from 1 - 10 minutes. A simple thing like changing the routers password was a staggering affair as not only do the labels on the page not make any sense, the documentation for the modem was also wrong.  I ended up having to search online for how to exactly do it.Eventually it got to the point I couldn't take it anymore and hit up Time Warner Cable support.  They where great, sent a tech out to take a look at my setup.  After one tech visit, I was still having problems with the modem.  The tech was confident that the everything was good on their end.However the modem kept dropping.  I then spent around 1.5 hours on the phone with another tech as we troubleshot the router.  The tech was getting all sorts of strange readings from it.  He couldn't get the ip from the router, it was showing 6 different mac ids connect too it (which was impossible) among other bizarre stuff.  We eventually settled on something is defiantly not right with this modem.Anyways I sent it back to Amazon, which so far has been great with returns.  I ended up going with aMotorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable ModemandNetgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Router WNDR3400and finally have a good setup.Just do yourself a favor, check out the reviews here and elsewhere online there is something majorly wrong with a large number of these modems.

I have posted a review of the SBG6580 under this listing on Amazon, but I also want to review it here since the Retail and Non-Retail packages contain exactly the same device.I hope this helps anyone considering the SBG6580....it is a lot of reading, but it is my story.  From March, 2012, to May, 2013, I had no problems.  Here is what I wrote about the SBG6580 on May 14, 2013:I have two of these in two different properties, and they work fine. Each property is about 1800 square feet, and they provide adequate coverage for these size locations. One is working with Time Warner in New York City, and the other is working with Comcast in Delray Beach Florida. I had no problems getting Time Warner to change their network to use my own modem, and the installation with Comcast was a new installation and I just gave them the C-Mac address and it worked with no problems.The unit in New York City is in a 56 story apartment building (my unit is on the 40th floor), and I can see about 40 to 50 wireless networks on my wireless devices. I have had no problems with interference from other networks.The wireless configuration menus are a lot more complicated than, say, the Apple Air-Port equipment I use at my primary residence, and unless you are experienced in setting up stuff like this you may have to fool with it to get everything to work the way you want it to. If you are a total dunce with stuff like this, you might have to get someone to help you. (Pretty much anyone can set up an Apple Air-Port!)I like that the modem, router, 4-port Ethernet switch, and wireless access point are combined into one box. This is especially important in smaller houses or apartments that do not have electronics closets or other places in which to locate this type of equipment. Eliminates a lot of clutter with separate boxes. Mine is located in the master bedroom on a bedside table, as that had a cable outlet already installed nearby. So it is at one end of the apartment, but I still get OK coverage at the other end of the apartment.Also, the apartment in NYC is not often occupied for months at a time. Since it was installed in March, 2012, I have not had one time where I had to re-set this box, even if I had not been there for 4 to 6 months. This is especially important to me as I have 4 Bayweb Internet thermostats that I need to be able to monitor and adjust from afar, and this has not let me down so far.The unit located in Delray Beach is in a house occupied by my son, and it has worked with no problems also and has never required re-setting. In this location, all the cable wires terminate in a box in the laundry room, which is more or less in the middle of the house, so I mounted it high on the wall there, and get good coverage on the first and second floor of this location.I also like the fact that I am saving the $7.00 modem fee that Comcast charges, and now Time Warner is also charging for their modems.And last, these units work fine with my MacBook Air, my iPhones, my iPods, my PCs, Skype, and my MagicJack phone service.* * *In early June, 2013, I had occasion to be at my apartment in New York City from June 6 to July 7, and noticed problems.  Here are my further comments about what I observed:UPDATE June 26, 2013Over the last few weeks, I have noticed that sometimes web pages were very slow to respond on the SBG6580 located at my New York apartment. After this happened a few times, I started up a few ping sessions (using Terminal on my Mac) and the next time this happened, I noticed the pings started failing at the same time the web pages would not load. This was happening perhaps once or more an hour and lasted perhaps 30 to 60 seconds. Then the problem cleared up, the web pages would load, and the pings did not fail.About the time I became really concerned about this, this failure happened while I was on the phone, using my MagicJack, which is connected to the Gateway using an Ethernet cable. I was really surprised that my call did not drop!So, I began suspecting that the Gateway was not disconnecting from the cable service, and the router was not resetting, or whatever, but that something was interrupting my wireless signal.I looked around my apartment and I discovered there was a cable outlet in my living room (behind a large piece of furniture), so I moved the Gateway to the living room. Previously it was located in a bed room, where a cable outlet was conveniently located.Now, my Mac is much closer to the Gateway -- less than 20 feet, and the signal strength is very strong. But the problem continued. So, next, I plugged my Mac into the Gateway using an Ethernet cable, and now there no more slow to load web sites or failing pings.So, it appears that the Gateway is staying connected to the Internet, the router is not becoming glitched, etc., and that something is interrupting the wireless signal. I am located on the 40th floor of a 56 story apartment building, and I can see dozens of WI-FI SSID's from my apartment, so there must be a huge amount of interference. I am going to borrow an Apple Airport and try it to see if it has the same issue. If the Apple also has this problem, then I believe it will be reasonable to assume my problem is related to interference. If the Apple works OK, then I think it will be a fair assumption that the wireless in this Gateway is not up to the task of working in a crowded RF environment. I will report my findings with this experiment in a few days.P.S. I have tried using various 2.4 GHz channels, and the auto setting, which has not resolved this issue. I would just go wired, but it is much more convenient to be able to move my Mac around the apartment, as well as we have iPhones and iPads and a second Mac that would not be easy to run an Ethernet cable to.UPDATE June 27, 2013:I hooked up an Apple AirPort Extreme to the Gateway, and have no interruption now in the WI-FI signal. I did not turn off the WI-FI that is built into the Motorola Gateway, just plugged it in and let the AirPort get an IP address from the Gateway for this test, and used a different SSID.Therefore, I conclude there is something about the SBG6580 Gateway's wireless that is either defective, or just cannot contend with all the other wireless signals that are all around me.I am going to take the SBG6580 to my house, which is in a suburban location where I cannot see other SSID's, and test it there to see if this problem continues or not. Only then will I know if there is something wrong in the Gateway's wireless section, or if the problem is just that the SBG6580 can not contend with all the other wireless signals. I will update this review when I have done that the week of July 8, 2013.For a permanent solution at my apartment I hooked up my old Motorola SB6121 cable modem, and am using the latest Apple Airport Extreme that I purchased yesterday. I really liked being able to have a single box that had 4 capabilities all in one box -- cut way down on the clutter to have the cable modem, router, wireless access point, and a 4 port Ethernet switch all in one box -- too bad. Now I have two boxes -- cable modem and Apple Airport.Update July 8, 2013:I have taken this to my house which is in a suburban location. I cannot see any other SSID except for my SSID from the SGB6580, as I am quite some distance from the closest house.The problem described above still occurs at this location. Since the SBG6580 is now in a location where there are no other WI-FI devices, the problem cannot be interference. And, there are no cordless phones at this location, nor are there any baby monitors or any other 2.4GHz devices which could cause interference.So, something has just gone wrong with the wireless portion of this router. When I first installed it I did not notice the problem of web pages sometimes being very slow to load, but starting about a month ago, I noticed this issue, and did the testing with the Ping utility described above.I would like to reiterate that the problem, which is a temporary loss of the ability to access the Internet, even with Ping, only occurs on devices that are connected wirelessly. When I connect my MacBook using Ethernet, to one of the four Ethernet ports on the SBG6580, everything works fine..

After a couple of months, the modem had to be rebooted every day to keep minimally acceptable performance.  Before I finally gave up on it and replaced it, I was rebooting it sometimes 4 times a day to get 1 to 2 Mbs down.  I replaced it with a Zoom 5431 and went back to my Linksys E1000.

I tend to turn it off if no one will be using it, and that's the true scoop on how I maintain this item. I had service connected through an existing cable wire. All the tech did was trim some off and put a much better end on the cable wire. I set it up completely without help, following the directions provided. The only reason a tech was at my house? The local bumpkin techs had disconnected the cable at the power line, which is why my service wasn't working the first day I set it up. Out f town Tech came the next day, performed the connect at power line as described, offered to come in and check the wire and performed the end change as described. My service was running and has been since except for one time. That one time was a cable company outage problem which they fixed within one hour. I have no idea, except for the age of the reviews, why there are so many bad comments. Maybe they improved the product since those were written?

I was paying for up to 3.0 mbps DSL from Verizon.  It was typically benchmarking at 700 kbps to 1.5 mbps.  My agreement with Verizon ended a few months ago.  About the same time Comcast began offering XFinity high speed internet up to 15 mbps in my area.  15 mbps is slow compared to other areas, but in my area it's a vast improvement.  So I switched to Comcast.  I didn't want to pay a monthly fee for a cable modem.  So began my research for a Cable Modem Router / Gateway with Wireless.Although somewhat expensive, and with some reservations, I decided on the Motorola SURFboard Gateway SBG6580 DOCSIS 3.0 Wireless Cable Modem.  My reservations were unfounded.  The Comcast tech enabled the high speed internet to my house, then fired up the SBG6580.  Account was created with Comcast.  I was on the internet.  Speed benchmarks averaged 20 mbps.  The tech departed and I proceeded to setup the Router / Gateway and Wireless.In 45 minutes I had it tweaked to my liking, including setting the wireless security, testing wireless, changing the Router / Gateway password (a must!), setting the SSID, etc.  "Firewall Protection" is the only item enabled under the "Firewall" Tab.  Wireless security is set to WPA2-PSK "Enabled" and WPA/WPA2 Encryption is set to "TKIP-WPA".  I created a WPA Pre-Shared Key.  All other Router / Gateway settings were left in the default (out of the box) state.  Once the WPA Pre-Shared Key was entered into my two laptop wireless configurations, they were on the internet.  I have not run any benchmark speed tests on the wireless connections.A few Notes:1.  I'm fairly technically savvy so the Modem Router / Gateway setup was easy for me.  For the non technical, it may be more challenging.  But if you've setup a Router before, this setup isn't any different.  To access the router settings, open your internet browser (Internet Explorer for most) and type in 192.168.100.1.  The default username and password I reveived in the documentation for this Router / Gateway is:Username:  adminPassword:  motorola2.  I use MagicJack for my home phone service.  MagicJack works perfectly with this Modem Router / Gateway.  There was no need to open any ports, or any other modifications to the Router / Gateway.  It just worked.  Previously with DSL and the Verizon provided router, the Router firewall had to be disabled to get MagicJack to work.  That was after many hours via online chat with MagicJack tech support.All in all, this was the smoothest ISP transition I've experienced.  The Motorola Modem Router / Gateway was a non issue.  It simply worked.  A week after the install, my wired pc benchmark speeds are still averaging about 20 mbps.  I couldn't me more pleased and would certainly buy this Modem Router / Gateway again.  Just perfect.  Got what I paid for in a positive way !!** For the record, I don't work for Verizon, Comcast, Motorola or MagicJack, and have no affiliation with them..

It seems that many of the early bugs/issues have been worked out, so long as you have an ISP who can release the latest firmware to the device. Cable modems are only able to be flashed by your ISP such as Comcast, and this modem may not be certified to work with all cable providers.So anyways, when it came to setup, it was pretty easy; again, as with all routers, I recommend AGAINST install disks and whatnot. Ethernet has fairly rigid protocals, and once you learn how to work with one router via the firmware interface, you can pretty much work with them all. I connected the cable modem to my coax and an ethernet port for a nearby PC (my HTPC); again, it's recommended at least for installation and setup to have a computer connected via ethernet. Comcast actually has a "self-install" program you run when you open up Internet Explorer (at least in my area they did), so I didn't even have to call them for setup! Pretty much followed the prompts, it took a few minutes (like 10-15 minutes) for the whole setup, the only issue I came across was I had to power-cycle the modem twice because of the firmware update; I called Comcast when it wouldn't startup after going through the prompts, and while on hold I power cycled again and it came on immediately; the tech said it was common for some to need two power cycles. While talking to the tech she looked over the signal numbers and everything, checked the firmware was up to date (I also did this via the firmware GUI), and everything was good to go!Next was setting up the wireless security, which was pretty much the same as any other router. I will say the Motorla GUI is very ugly and not as user-friendly as say Netgear/Linksys, but still it was easy to setup WPA2 security, change the broadcast name and set the password. The only issue I ran into with this was when I enabled both TKIP/AES encryption it went really really slow over the wireless, when I switched to AES only my wireless connection speed jumped dramatically (which was odd, could be an underlying issue, or could have to do with how my last wireless network was configured, I didn't really troubleshoot), but all my devices are AES compliant so no issues with that.My previous setup was the SB5101 and a Linksys E2500 router which worked well, but with Comcast charging $7/month for the modem rental I figured I should buy my own modem (the SB5101 lasted for about 4 years and still worked fine). Because the SB5101 was so solid I didn't notice a major speed increase moving to this DOCSIS 3.0 modem; the SB5101 would get 30Mb/s download, whereas the SBG6580 gets 35Mb/s download (on a 30Mb/s plan). I purchased the SBG6580 because Motorola makes solid modems, and I found the SBG6580 used for the same price as the SB6121. The SBG6580 gets slightly less range than my E2500 router, but plenty adequate and covers my whole house with no problems, and I really like the Gigabit ports built in and the elimination of a device plus cords from the seperate modem/router.Pros:+Fast+Seems reliable (1 month, no restarts needed or speed drops)+Eliminates needing seperate devices+Gigabit ports+Wireless N Dual-Band+DOCSIS 3.0 (may be required by most ISPs soon, necessary for faster speeds)+Seems well-built, which Motorola is well known for.Cons:-Price (although for both a router/modem it's not bad)-Unproven reliability (Gateways typically don't last as long as a seperate modem/router setup and lack features of nice routers, we shall see with this one though)-Setup may be difficult for some-Ugly firmware GUI-Previous firmware seems glitchy for many users, not all ISPs will provide the latest firmware, and no way to manually update.So in summary, I'm pretty impressed with this little device. The speeds are good, the wireless is good, and it's such a small device that dose so much. I plan on wiring the house with CAT6 soon, and have a Gigabit switch I will utilize next to this SURFboard. Also, Comcast is such a rip-off with the $7 rental fee, it truly makes sense now for people to buy their own routers, especially if you get a good sale..

Most of my devices work better at 5, but my WiFi printer only supports 2.4.- Poor range, slow. My Apple devices worked very poorly with this router, especially my Macbook Air. I could achieve maximum internet speeds only if I was less than five feet from the router. The further away I got, the weaker the signal and slower the performance. My 50Mbps broadband service was slowed to 2-15Mbps less than 25 feet away. Signal strength and performance was better in the upstairs room directly above the router, but on the other side of the house upstairs it was practically unusable. My Windows laptop worked much better at my desk, averaging between 30-35Mbps. Now you could place part of the blame on Apple, but I didn't have these issues with my old router and I don't with my new one. 5gHz performance was no better. My media server was Ethernet hardwired to the Surfboard and consistently achieved solid 50Mbps speed tests.-Dynamic DNS did not work. After the initial setup, the SGB6580 would not update Dynamic DNS and I would get the email from them once a month telling me to update or else my host would be deleted.-Buggy. I attempted to use the parental controls as sort of an experiment to block the facebook.com domain from my house, but the interface was unintuitive and flaky. Not only was I was never able to get the parental feature working, I also had to hard reset the thing several times and at one point I thought I'd bricked it. The port forwarding feature did work well. These were the only features I attempted to use.I ended up returning the SBG6580 to TWC and traded it in for a Motorola SB6141, (DOCSIS 3.0 modem only) which I paired up with my new Asus RT-N66U.

The hardware, always good, just keeps getting better.  The current drives use WD green drive technology that spins the drive only as fast as needed and slows it down at other times.  Saves considerable energy.The drives fall short of my expectations in two ways.  First, WD needs to be much more forthright about the "security" features they provide.  Their specs are vague and some would lead you to believe their security feature hardware encrypts the content of the drive.  The fact that I can turn it on and off with change of a password and it takes zero time to re-write the disk suggests the feature really is not much more than password access to the drive -- something that is much less desirable from a security perspective.  I was expecting hardware encryption.  I don't think I got it.  Second, WD provides some basically grossly over-simplified back-up software.  It provides no ability to control which directories are backed up; all or nothing.  Don't bother to install it!.

I decided to purchase this unit at a local store rather than from Amazon (sorry Amazon) in case I needed to return it.  Well, after a bit of configuration, I now have a huge amount of storage recognized on my WIN7 machine.  There are lots of detailed reviews here so I will only relate things I found that may be helpful to others.1. My version of the HDD did not have a virtual CD embedded.  The software was clearly evident on the main directory.  I decided to copy off the entire suite of files and placed it on my C drive in case I ever needed it.2. The WD drive manager installed automatically, I did not have a driver search dialog for that come up.3. The version of my HDD had the latest firmware.  Be careful, because the utility to update the firmware needs to have only that hard drive connected to the system.4. In my case I installed a 4 port USB 3 card in my PCIE slot.  Make sure that the drivers are installed before trying to use the HDD.  Since I just connected everything, I have yet to validate the USB 3 speed.  If there is a problem I will update this review.5. At this point I am not installing any of the software.  I used a similar utility on my Maxtor but ended up removing it because of the lack of precise control.  Better off using something like Acronis or WIN7 backup.6. I will consider getting an additional unit if this remains stable and reliable.Here are the shortcomings:- USB cable is very short- On/Off switch should be a rocker, this one is a cheapo push-button and its difficult to tell if you turn the machine on or off and I have had to remove the plug several times- It would really be nice to have a regular size plug and with the converter in line on the wire, this has got a larger plug though at least its not a brickFrom my perspective, either the problems people have faced with the HDD have been corrected, or I was just merely lucky. Since I have chosen not to install the software, I only removed a single star because of the shortcomings listed..

I haven't had an issue with the USB being flimsy either as I just leave it plugged in at all times and when I must unplug it I unplug it from the computer, not the drive itself. I have to say though I was a bit shocked at the size because I expected it to be bigger, not small. But that isn't a huge deal to me.  So if you aren't computer savvy and need the extra space (like me) then this product is for you.**Update 5/08/2013**I still love my external drive...except that I have had to reformat it a few times since I first plugged it in. I currently at this time am in the process of reformatting it. Fingers crossed though this fixes this issue, but if not I think it will be time to send it back in exchange for a new one v.v**Update 9/03/2013**So after almost a year and a constant error I had finally gave up and sent it in. WD makes it a huge hassle just to send in an item.. However, as soon as they received it they shipped out a refurbished one and I have had it all of maybe 2 weeks...and I still get an error about the drive, letting me know the recycle bin is broken. I am not sure how to get rid of it because even reformatting my other one over and over..the error still popped up.

I have not had a problem with this WD unit to date.  I have read most of the reviews here both good and bad.  I have had the WD since Jan. 2012 and to date has not burped, sizzle, smoke, and the worse sound is a metal clicking sound.  Now I say this and if it goes southward I will be very angry.  Pound for Pound ease of use, set up and depending on your data you are saving for the initial back-up I would say anything over 100gb is going to take several hours, so don't stop it or use the computer while it is doing this.  Also, shut down all applications running before you plug this bad boy in to your USB  slot.

Plug in the power cord, plug in the usb and poof, you have the drive show up on your computer. You can use the software on the drive for backups, format the drive altogether or use your backup of choice. Also, like any external drive you can use it for storage.Use: Everything worked as normal for about 6 hours. I was transferring about 1.5TB of data to the drive via WIFI, then the drive malfunctioned, stopped backing up and lost most of my files. Keep in mind my 1TB version has been running non stop (still using it today) for almost 3 years. I use it for Time Machine backups on 2 Macs and work from home so its being written to for at least 10-12 hours a day.Conclusion:Thankfully the program Disk Warrior was able to get my files back. The drive reported a hardware malfunction and after mounting would not allow me to add files to it.  I promptly contacted Amazon and they allowed me to return it for a full refund. I then started reading reviews looking for similar issues and it seems many others had this problem as well. Theres something wrong with the 3TB drives. I ordered a 2TB version, ran the same setup and so far all is running smooth.

While my system did not initially come with a USB 3.0 connector and I was forced to purchase an external card, once installed it runs very fast. I'm using this drive on a Linux web and media server. I installed a "Syba USB 3.0 SuperSpeed 2-port PCI-Express USB adapter - PCI Express 2.0 x1" (uses the short white NON-VIDEO PCIE motherboard connector). This controller uses an NEC chipset fully supported under newer (2.6-32+) Linux kernels so installation went without a hitch. I mounted the drive using it's default format (NTFS) and it worked perfect from the moment it mounted.I am most impressed with the overall speed of this drive. Using a gigabit network I am able to copy data at sustained rates exceeding 110 mega bytes per second, In some cases as fast as 140 meg for short periods. Compared to the USB 2.0 drive that transferred at around 40 meg per second this drive is a dream! I can copy digital movies, pictures, raw camera files, even rip Bluerays in minutes.The drive is a bit large compared to their "Elements" series. The "Elements" lies flat and is only 1.5 cm high whereas this drive stands upright, is larger in all dimensions and appears to want to be operated in the upright position based on the position of the feet. It comes with an external power supply (unnecessary?), a good quality albeit short cable and a large unfolding quick installation guide.Because it is an external drive it would be difficult to use it as a bootable system disk but with an appropriate motherboard supporting alternate boot methods this drive could be configured as a system disk for either Linux or Windows but would require more than the average understanding of computer hardware to make it work.Speed, a reputable company and large storage capacity make this a perfect choice if you already have a media server and want to increase it's storage capacity. I upgraded from an "Elements" 2 tb USB 2.0 drive. If you don't have an existing media server you might want to check out Western Digital's NAS (Network Attached Storage) drives that come with built-in network sharing firmware eliminating the need for a separate server. NAS drives have an RJ45 connector (TCP/IP) and function just like a Windows or Linux file server..

I took the drive to a data recovery service and what would have cost only $300 to recover, because it's a MyBook, made the price of recovery skyrocket to several THOUSAND dollars! Why? Because the "geniuses" over at WD put a 256 bit ENCRYPTION chip in the external cases of each MyBook and each case has a unique key that is the only way to recover your data, so basically they would have to fix the external shell case to be able to recover any data, pushing the cost of recovery way above what it should be (and what I can afford). Normal hard drives (That you can put in your OWN external case for $20) do not have this problem and I would recommend buying an internal drive and buying a cheap external case for it, it's the SAME difference!

I've had this for about one month, so I can't judge its reliability.  I've had another WD drive for about 18 months, which has worked fine.  It was easy to set up out of the box, just plug and play.  It differs from the prior generation of WD My Books in that this supports USB 3.0 instead of eSata.  My computer doesn't have USB 3.0, so I can't tell how this performs.  The new version has improved the software in at least one material respect.  The prior generation of WD My books go into sleep mode after 10 minutes.  This is fine for a back up drive, as it saves power and probably extends life, since these generate heat when operating and most home external drives have inadequate internal fans, leading to failures.  However, the sleep mode was not adjustable by the user, so the transfer rate would be affected if you were using this when it was asleep.  The new version allows you to adjust the sleep mode, which is how this feature should work.  The Drive also comes with back up software that automatically backs up files for you.  I use different software for this function (Norton Ghost), and can't say how well it works.  From the documentation, it looks like this will back up regular files, but probably not system files, so this may not work to allow a full system restore.  This didn't bother me because I am not using that software..

I think it's just because a spike in HD prices hasn't caught up with the old inventory price for the MyBook, but here's an opportunity to make a few bucks-- strip out the drive and sell it on eBay.You may not want to though. The one I bought failed after nine months.I'm not sure if it's the drive, the connector (see other reviews here for broken USB 3.0 connector woes-- I don't think that's the problem with mine), the cable, or something else; but Windows 7 hangs whenever the drive is connected, and eventually reports that the drive must be formatted. An attempt to format it always fails, whether from the dialog it presents or from Windows' Disk Management utility.On the other hand, it saved my bacon more than once while it was alive, so I can't give it fewer stars. Three seems about right. The first thing I did was to make a system image onto the drive using the Backup & Restore control panel, and have automatically updated that once a week. This system image helped a great deal when a buggy ATi video card driver update hosed my whole system. It often fails when done automatically, so when I remember I do it manually. If I get a replacement, I think I'll shut off the automated backup utility (SmartWare) and just use the native backup tools during times when I'm away.I never recovered a file using SmartWare, but it seemed to chug along efficiently and not get in the way (until the big failure, of course). I'm using it with a USB 2.0 port and the speed was neither impressively fast nor torturously slow.I've submitted a support request and hope WD will honor it, either with a refund or a replacement.UPDATE 5 Dec 2011: After a few weeks of back-and-forth, they did indeed send me a new drive. I installed the firmware update and SmartWare update without problems, and now we see whether this one can outlast the previous model. Cross fingers. I *do* like WD's products-- most of my system builds have used their HDs-- and I can see that the occasional lemon gets released..

This is a great mouse except for the button problems. Logitech needs to do something to increase the longevity of the buttons, shouldn't have to be replacing it in 6 months of moderate usage. Everything else still works great, just crappy buttons.I will have to look into replacing the buttons with better buttons that will last longer myself (maybe buttons from a keyboard?) or look for a replacement mouse somewhere else. I really liked this design and would hate to go back to using a mouse pad type of mouse, which really wouldn't work well for me. I like to recline in my comfortable chair with the keyboard on my lap and mouse on my leg.

I would hate to have to go back to sitting at a table or desk to use my computer just because of the mouse...______________________________________________________________________________________________bought one Jan 2011, best mouse/Trackball i've used. Use to have the wired version but seems isn't available any longer, so bought the wireless version. Works as well as a wired mouse, never had second thoughts about having bought this wireless mouse.Now 2 years later it has been giving me double or more clicks with left button when clicking just once for several months now. Seems to be getting worse and doing double clicks more often... almost constant. Other then that mouse still works great.Will be replacing it with a new M570 Trackball. I seldom work at a desk and when I do there isn't much room for a regular mouse and mouse pad.

The M570 will be used as a remote pointing device for a Toshiba A505 Satellite Win7 laptop when it is connected by HDMI cable to a Widescreen TV.  The range on the receiver is very good and the M570 works from anywhere in the viewing room.Some of the small touches are appreciated, such as providing optional storage for the receiver inside the battery compartment.  When plug and play completed I was ready to download the SetPoint software to customize pointer movement and acceleration.  However, after working with the M570 for several minutes, it became clear that the pointer movement and acceleration were prefect for me using the default settings.It's very nice that the built in laptop touch pad works at the same time the M570 is working, so either can be used.  This is handy because the M570 is kept in the seating area, so if something needs to be done at the laptop which is kept near the TV, the touch pad works as it always has.P.S. A note about the TrackMan Wheel and why I am on the 4th one since 2003.  I use the desktop about 12-16 hours a day 7 days a week.  I wore out the ball on the first Trackman Wheel, and the left mouse click went bad on the last two from heavy use.  If the switch used in the M570 for left mouse click is the same one used in the wired TrackMan Wheel, then the M570 may wear out in about 2 years in that type of heavy use.  This is not a complaint because Logitech has been excellent about replacing units that have failed during the warranty period. I do not expect this M570 to wear out because it will get light to normal use, not heavy use..

The unit works well and feels well made. The only problem I have is that it is too small. I am an average size 5'10" guy with moderate size hands. The problem is the spread of the fingers across the 2 buttons and wheel. The spread from the thumb to Index finger are fine. However my middle finger falls on the second button and not the scroll wheel and my ring finger falls off the button onto the side of the mouse and is useless. It should be index on first button, Middle finger on scroll and ring finger on second button. Also the small back and forward buttons are in the wrong position. The forward button is too far up for the index finger to reach w/o lifting your entire hand up to reach it. If you have a long index finger, about 3.5" measuring from the start of your index finger,  you should have no problem. Those are the only ergonomic problems for me.  I will keep it because it does work great. I will just have to slightly reposition my middle & ring fingers when I have to use the scroll wheel and second button. It would be perfect for women who have moderate size hands and long fingers & men with fingers that are narrow and long but moderate size palms.UPDATE 1/11/2012 - HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL!  M570 Wireless trackball still working great. My hand adjustment took only a short time to get use too this mouse and now feels comfortable.  Bought another one to have as a back-up.

It's annoying enough that I may just replace it with a bluetooth pointer. The pointer hangs, then moves wildly around the screen. I've done some looking on the web and I'm not alone. Too bad, it's a really comfy device and it works GREAT 20 feet away, just not too good right next to the laptop. When I have my HDMI hooked to my 55 inch TV and get away from the laptop it's perfect.

Being wireless is a nice feature, as the cord always seemed to get in the way on my old one.Setup was easy and it is very accurate.

They're terrific products, from the original corded version, through this one. They use much less desk space than a mouse, and they are easier on your shoulder and elbow. The problem in the past with the Trackman wireless, is that the reciever was big, had a dongle cord, and had very limited range - usually about six feet or less. This new trackball is perfect for a home theater PC, as it seems to still have great response fifteen feet or so away (maybe farther, I had no cause to test it from farther),and now you can use a single, micro-reciever for both trackball and keyboard. While Logitech had mice and keyboard combinations before, they didn't have a trackball and keyboard option. If you've used your mouse, even optical mouse, on your easy-chair or couch arm, you're going to like this option a lot. (There's a little slot inside the battery port to hold the receiver for transport, this too is a new feature, along with an on-off switch.) Battery life on all Logitech products is ridiculously long. I'd be surprised of you had to change batteries more than twice a year.There is a little more resistence on this mouse than on the previous model, but not something that needs to be adjusted to conciously. In the past, I've used a hard-shell car wax on the trackballs, letting it harden for an hour or so, just the way you would in waxing your car, then polising it off, and it smooths up the motion quite a bit. (Yes, remove the ball from the unit before waxing.) Also, when you clean the mouse, also reach inside and clean the lint and whatnot from the three bearings. I've had several friends who were baffled at why their trackball didn't smooth-up even after they cleaned it. It's because the bearings actually collect the ling, oil, and other smeg from your thumb and gum up a bit after a few months. A quick wipe with a paper towel or microcloth can make all the difference.I've only had this new one for a day or so, so I can't speak to the durability, but the old models were good for 5+ years, and I'm only replacing mine because of the improved receiver. (Oh, I use it with both Macs and PCs. No problems on either, yet. Plug and play.) You'll need to have the latest Logitech software to program the extra buttons, but I'd suggest not setting it on "auto-update" or it will nag you to death.If you're a gamer, particularly a FPS player, used to an optical mouse, this may take quite a bit of getting used to, and may never have the twitch response you like. For RT strategy titles like Starcraft II, however, it's terrific..

I never bother to turn the mouse off unless I was packing it up for travel. A single cheap battery lasted me 9 months. I've used it for everything from web browsing to design work to playing Skyrim. More precise games, like FPS were not really doable, but for less demanding games such as Civ 5 or Skyrim, it worked great. It is also a very durable product. I've dropped it a few dozen times, and it still works great. The right-mouse button has some issues with staying clicked when I hold it down (only really noticeable in gaming), but as much as I've abused this thing, that was bound to happen.The ball does get dirty fairly quickly, so you have to pop it out and and clean out the gunk about once a month. Very little maintenance. If the ball starts feeling like it isn't rolling as smooth, it's time to clean it.The battery slot has a very convenient place to put the universal dongle when traveling, that has proven itself very useful. Haven't lost the dongle :). Speaking of the dongle, the range has been very good for me. 15 feet with an almost clear line of site, and no issues with connectivity and response time.Very comfortable, although you will find your thumb fatigued from time to time. It helps to keep a more standard mouse in the rotation for times like that.The logitech m570 has found a permanent place in life. For $35, it was a great purchase.***Original***Let me tell you something, I HATE the track pads that come on laptops. However, mice can be so inconvenient for laptops because you need a surface to use it on. The trackball is great for people who don't have a lot of desk space or find themselves sitting somewhere without a desk at all. Not moving my arm around is great, no more sore wrist for me. The trackball comes presynced with the universal USB dongle and works out of the box with Ubuntu. Pairing multiple devices with the dongle will require windows or Mac for now. Logitech has stated that they will soon be supporting Linux. We'll see...Anyway, I don't think I could use this for gaming, but for just working it is perfect.

My setup prevented me from using a conventional mouse since I sit in a leather chair, my laptop across the room and hooked up to my TV. I really got used to the mechanics of using my thumb instead of my arm/wrist and hoping this was the answer. Here have been my conclusion so far:Pros:Wireless - I also bought a wireless keyboard for my setup which made it nice since I can just use one dongleOn/Off Switch - This is a great feature since a lot of the cheaper wireless mice do not have this feature.Packaging - I know a lot of people that review items get all hung up on packaging and I am not sure why... Let's put it this way, I had both the keyboard and mouse out of their packaging in less than 1 minute without tearing up any of the boxes.Battery light - Gives you a warning if it's running low. Most mice just leave you hanging.Cons:Smooth movement : When I first rolled around the ball it didn't seem to roll as smooth as I remembered the other mice did. It wasn't hard to move but just probably needs to be broken in a bit.Wishlist:Ball bearing wheel - I also have a Logitech Performance MX mouse I use at work and love the smooth scrolling. I wished this had that option to have a click scroll or free scroll.Rechargeable - I am a big fan of the MX mouse being rechargeable. It would be nice if this mouse could be charged while using or charge while it's not being used.Overall this is a great mouse so far. I know I have a few things on the wishlist that I would love Logitech integrate into this mouse. I would be willing to pay the extra money for those features but I know there probably isn't a big market for people using this type of mouse. Thumball/Trackball mice aren't for everyone. I would advise borrowing one for a while if you are considering buying then make the purchase if it feels right, that is how I got started with this type of mouse and go back to it when I need to..

It has been disappointing that the left button will only give a quick click now. No longer will it allow click & drag.

So, it has gotten relatively heavy use.FWIW, the best review of this device is &#34;Logitech answers the plea!&#34;. If you are considering this trackball read that review. It pretty much tells the story all the way down to the slight resistance the ball presents compared to the red ball wired models.  Occasionally, this resistance has caused minor frustration during a precision image crop, or Lightroom slider adjustments.  Easing up to the lightest possible touch with one's thumb may help a little with an ultra-precision click & drag.In conclusion, I still like this trackball enough that, in spite of this ones failure, I am ordering another before this one heads to the recycle bin..

As the other reviewers have mentioned, it is very sturdy and the connections are nice and snug on my Motorola Atrix.  The supplied Moto Atrix cable for charging is way too short when trying to use your phone as its charging, but the length of this cable is perfect for just that.  The added bonus, and usually the sign of a high quality cable, is you can actually use the phone while it is charging on either household or PC USB connection, it does not freeze the phone at all.  I have a cheaper generic cable I bought several years ago elsewhere for my Moto KRZR, and it freezes my Atrix up.  Once again, just goes to show, don't let the price fool you people.Also, the seller of this product did a first rate job for me with not only a great price, but reasonable and fast shipping as well.  I do not see an option to leave them feedback for some reason (maybe I missed their email) but I would not hesitate to do business with them again and will seek them out to do just that when I need something again.The following is for those of use who use Amazon regularly and sometimes forget what a great company Amazon is, as I know I tend to take them for granted and get steamed when things don't go quite right:Ryan with Amazon customer service is to be commended for the excellent customer service he provided for myself and Amazon.  I called Friday, July 29, at approximately 2:15 PM, kindly asking why my order had been sitting at the FedEx SmartPost facility for over 24 hours with no movement (no need to be mad at Ryan or Amazon, right?  I was very upset with FedEx though.).  I could hear the concern and disappointment in Ryan's voice when I explained the above to him and that I had wanted the slacks I ordered with this cable in time for church Sunday, which is why I ordered Friday, July 22nd, and did not use the free shipping option.  Ryan apologized for the delay and asked if I would mind being put on hold while he contacted the shipping carrier to see what the hold up was and see if he could get my slacks positively delivered Saturday.  I did not mind at all and was glad I had someone who cared.  When Ryan came back on the line, Ryan's disappointment with the carrier was clearly visible as they seemed to have a don't care attitude and could not guarantee a Saturday delivery of an item that had been sitting in their business for nearly 48 hours, really.  Ryan apologized once again and guaranteed I'd have my pants by Sunday because he was cancelling that order and resubmitting another order for my two items with Next Day Air at no cost to me for either the order or shipping.  This was 2:15 in the afternoon now!!I was blown away by Ryan's genuine concern and caring about resolving my issue and having my order on time as promised, but truthfully doubted that was possible (and did not really care at this point because of Ryan's genuine concern).  And just like clockwork, before I went to work Saturday, July 30, the FedEx man came rolling up with my order at approximately 11:30 AM!!!  I left the details of this in my satisfaction email sent out by Amazon, and I hope they remunerate Ryan for such an awesome job.  Thank you again Ryan and Amazon (and Haggar, the slacks are AWESOME)!!!!!.

This time everything was just as described and I got them in just two days, via my prime account.They are looking very well built and the length is really nice.  My smartphone is sitting here right now, plugged into my computers' USB port charging up my phone.  So now I have to take time on Monday, my day off, and drive down to a UPS store and mail the wrong cables that Amazon sent me back to them so I can received my credit.

Even with the heavier lenses, it isn't difficult to hold. The IS (Iso Stabilization) feature is a blessing. I have ruined countless shots with camera shake. Thus far, I've only had one failure and that was when I tried a close up at a very long distance.I recommend this camera highly. It does everything I want it to do.

It was easy to use, it had fully auto settings, and also has an array of auto settings which allow creative shooting, along with a fully manual mode to use as you please. I ordered the camera in December of 2012 and used it through the year, relatively sporadically. It takes great photos and it is a very good quality camera. I would recommend the T3i (as this one is) over the T3, as the T3 is only 12 MP, and the T3i is 18 MP, which is much better in terms of digital performance.  So all good up till now...HOWEVER...I took the camera with me to my Florida home for Christmas this year, and noticed that the lens would not auto focus. It then would not shoot. I took it off, cleaned it, tried to get it to work, and no luck.I then took it to a camera store and the clerk told me the lens (which comes with the camera) was shot. It was under a year old, and I take very good care of my equipment. So it mystified me as to why this would have happened. Then, I reread the warranty and saw that the whole thing is warranted for one year. By the time I had done this, I was already a few days over and I had no choice but to order another lens for $200 so I could shoot pictures at Christmas. My daughter has the same camera and has had no trouble, but I have to say this was a black mark for me on this Canon camera.

I own both the D60 and D600 and this camera wins.-The D60 is far heavier, but the construction is exactly the same (same plastic/rubber). There's no justification for the added weight. Seriously canon, why is it so heavy? It's the same sensor and software.-The larger LCD is useless since you'll be mounting an LCD viewfinder on top anyway.-$300 price is totally not justified. Save the money for lenses or other gear.-The camera can shoot at 5.7fps (vs 3.1 on the D600), only useful for still photographers. Also, it can shoot at 1/8000 vs 1/4000, again, useless for film.I think most people who buy this camera are doing so purely because they believe it looks and feels more professional, they don't really understand it's the same hardware. My advice is either step up to a full frame body, or buy the T3I. The D60 is an odd one in the lineup, not sure what canon was thinking. They're charging 40% more for added weight.When someone talks about shooting film with a D60, I don't think "professional".  I think "you don't really understand your camera.".

In full auto mode, the T3i beats the Nikon.  They are probably identical in the hands of a pro using manual settings, but in auto the D5100 has lousy white balance and notable motion blur.Then we compared the T3i head to head against the D5100, the Sony Alpha 55, and the Canon 60D.  Found the 60D to be too heavy, and that the 18-135mm lens is also too heavy and cumbersome.  I really liked the fixed mirror of the Sony and continuous phase autofocus in live view and movie mode.  But the snapshots of the T3i were slightly better.  With the shortcomings of the a55, it is probably a tier lower and thus overpriced.  I think we'd have bought the a77 over the T3i if both were $700 for the body and 18-55mm kit.The T3i excels under low light, the whole point of moving up from a point and shoot.  It was hard to not go with a mirrorless or fixed mirror system, but the T3i had the best pictures, simple as that.  After taking about 600 pictures in the last few days, had to learn a little about the semi-auto features.  Very useful are setting white balance to scene instead of using auto or a preset, and using portrait mode for indoor shots and putting the flash up or down as desired.  Also find shutter priority mode helpful to get shots without motion blur, and also like locking max auto ISO to 1600 or 800 for lower noise.The bottom line is that we get extremely natural looking photos taken indoors at night without flash.  I took pictures in dim tungsten lighting that look like they were taken in the afternoon with indirect sunlight coming in the windows.  Amazing--why we bought the camera and why it gets 5 stars.Also bought the Tamron 18-200mm zoom lens and the Rode Videomic Pro as accessories--both of those earn 5 stars, too.We purchased the T3i and the Tamron lens online from B&H; who has a no-hassle return policy..

Otherwise I would've returned it. You shouldn't need manual to understand the basics of a camera in my opinion. It takes a while to get used to... and it's a style of camera I'd rather NOT get used to. Unintuitive. Seriously do not understand CANON's thinking. If I didn't shoot video for a living and if I had the money I would jump ship and stay with Nikon.- This camera is basically a poor man's studio camera that fronts as a easy-to use DSLR. It's not.- Megapixel count is slightly bloated. Again, you only need to extra pixel for editing. I also own a Nikin D90 with only 12M. Similar quality. Way better function!

I watched some videos on youtube and skimmed the manual online while I was waiting for it to come in the mail (I ordered it from a different site around New Year's, so I had about a week and a half wait from when I ordered it) and as soon as I got it, charged the battery and started using it. Before this, I was using my video camera or old point and shoot for stills, but I have used a couple of other people's DSLRs (on auto mode). I've been using this exclusively in manual mode so far and it took a little bit the first day to get used to picking the right exposure settings, but once I got used to it, it's not bad. This camera takes really great photos.Other good things are: compared to my Canon Vixia HF200 (video camera), the battery seems to last a comparable length with video and the recording rate is somewhere around 5.5 mb/s with the T3i, where it goes up to 24mb/s (I believe) on the HF200, so the videos don't take up as much room on the memory card or my computer, but they look better because of the lenses and, I assume, the proccessing. The audio is surprisingly good too. I shoot videos at shows occasionaly(**Youtube search username chunkvideos and look at the Pianos Become The Teeth videos for the best example**), I manually adjusted the audio level to the lowest possible level (it indicated clipping otherwise) and the video actually sounds really good. That being said, when you're not in a loud environment, the internal mic picks up all of the camera and handling noises, so the fact that it has a mic input jack will come in handy in getting better audio.The autofocus works good sometimes. I'm trying to mostly use manual focus unless I'm taking a photo of my puppy running around the yard or something with similar action (which is also hard to autofocus on, btw). I used autofocus the first few days and it wouldn't always focus where I wanted it to (it'd focus on my puppy's nose or toys instead of her eyes, etc). I know there is a way to select focus points, but I'd rather just do it manually, plus it doesn't have full time autofocus while shooting video. Autofocusing on video does not look or sound good with this camera.I haven't used the vari-angle screen as much as I thought I would yet, but even without using it for different angles, it's pretty convenient. I like that I can store it with the screen facing towards the camera body, so it's protected. I also like that when I have it flipped out to the side, my nose isn't against the screen and there is a little extra room for my face when I'm looking through the viewfinder. I have tried "self portraits" with it (in quotes because half of them were just me pointing the camera at my face), but it's hard to do without a tripod because neither of my lenses will focus closer than 18". It's kind of hard with a tripod too, because of focusing before you get to where you're going to stand (again, autofocus wouldn't focus on my face).Continuous shooting and exposure bracketing are really nice features. I also like that you can do both with a timer. Exposure bracketing is something that I overlooked when I was researching camera options, because I didn't know what it was. You can quickly and easily set your camera to take 3 continuous photos with the same aperature, but at different shutter speeds, so it produces an under exposed, normally exposed, and over exposed version of the same shot (assuming you use a tripod or hold the camera really still) and if you use software that can merge the three images into one, you can create an image that shows details in the dark, light, and medium areas of the photo. For instance, in a normal photo of a sunset, the sun would be bright and anything like trees or buildings in the foreground would be dark, merging would allow you to see details in the foreground too.Pros:-Photo quality-Manual settings-Ease of use-Manual focus-Low noise-Good low light shots-1080p video with good quality-Manual settings for video-Vari-angle screen-Mic input jack-Manual audio levels-Small file sizes for HD video-Not too big or heavy-The flash doesn't pop up in manual mode (it hasn't for me anyway)-It actually comes with usable software (I've been doing all of my photo editing with the included software, I think it's called Digital Photo Professional)-It can store camera and lens setting information on your photos (not literally on them, but in the file information)-Continuous shooting works nicely-Exposure bracketing is a cool feature which allows you to edit high dynamic range photos-Able to use a timer and choose how many shots you want the camera to take and if you want it to be exposure bracketed or notCons:-Autofocus hasn't worked well for me-Cropped sensor makes it hard to get wide angle shots without spending a lot on a nice lensUpdate: I've gotten some better lenses since writing this review and the autofocus issue seems to have had to do with the lenses and not the camera..

I'm definitely glad I opted for this camera. The most noticeable feature, the articulating LCD, is far more than a little add-on to me, since I have an issue with positioning myself to use a fixed position live view, much less the viewfinder when the camera is in some locations. The ability to use an external mic for stereo video sound is another great feature. The available settings & options seem nearly limitless to me at this point. Among the many other highlights is the quality of the 18 MP resolution. Since I just received the camera a week ago, I plan to update this review when I have more time with it.I went from a Canon XTi to this model and the transition has been totally AWESOME.

The pros and cons of which I would not go into because the fact remains in the ultimate choice of a person and in the finances they have at their disposal sine both these brands have similar features with "+s and -s" in their own distinctive categories over which they have ruled and still improving on respectively.What I can say from my interaction and use of the camera has improved my photos tremendously and this is mostly in part to the extended and fully capable feature set of this camera. It has been a great introductory DSLR experience for me and this is what I can base my recommendation on and it has only served to improved my thirst for creating better images which has led me to researching materials and training videos to get my skill set up to scratch.I bought the camera with the standard EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens and it is a great learning lens for beginners I can definitely see myself progressing to other high-powered lens as I immerse further into the DSLR world and image photography. All with the ultimate goal of transforming what the eyes see on a daily basis into photography, capturing the moment in time and translating it into a story that can be felt by many through their own eyes.I will definitely recommend this camera to those who want to take the bold leap into the DSLR photography world, I can assure you that you will be amazed.....

Always being interested in photography and being somewhat creative I thought that the point-to-shoot area has come to an end.  However, it is of course not a cheap investment - especially when you buy the T3i with the 18-135mm lens.  So you are perhaps wondering - was it worth the money?  And the answer is yes!  Even without getting to creative and playing with the variety of manual settings you can make photos in the auto-modes that will make your point-to-shoot camera photos look like photos taken with a cell phone.  The colors and focus on specific objects give the photos more dynamics.  The different modes allow you to select the right auto-setting for the object you are trying to capture.  The screen info on the T3i helps compared to the T2i (my dad has one) when you are new to such camera.  Overall I am very satisfied.  If you are considering to purchase the T3i, then you should think about getting the 18-135mm lens compared to the 18-55mm lens.  Reason being that the 135mm lens gives you more tele and you can zoom more than with the 55mm introduction lens.  If you are planning to get a tele-lens anyway and want to go higher up (i.e. 300mm), then the 55mm should do it.  However, I know myself and do not want to necessarily change lens depending on the distance of the object and the 135mm seems to be the right fit..

I am still learning the different functions. It has a lot of functions that i doubt i will ever use but that's the way that the digitals are done. the older film 35mm cameras were easier to manipulate- less choices like instant iso/shutter speed/exposure times changes without having to go through a menu- but the possibilities are still huge and just take time to master. i always recommend getting a uv filter to protect any lens you use and a lens hood that collapses. fits in the camera bag better. lenses change easy. very nice grip also. if you have older equipment, such as tripods, mini tripod clamps, lens hoods/filters they do integrate on the new lenses and fit on the camera bodies. if it doesn't fit, work it a little bit but to not force it. the filters are cheap-cheap-cheap compared to messing up the filter threads on the lens. I had many older filters/special effect filters/hoods etc that only required a step-up ring to mount on the new lens. try to integrate your older equipment. even though this was a package lens/camera bundle, i have gotten some awesome close ups just using the lens that came in the bundle and the macro setting. i am going to play awhile before investing in a macro lens or a more powerful telephoto zoom lens. camera is stable. i do not use the digital viewer to shoot. i use the viewfinder and use the nice sized screen on the back to review the shot. saves battery life..

The already highly competent, older Rebel T2i already shared many important features with the 60D (and even features of the semi-pro 7D) including the 18 MP sensor, 63-zone exposure metering system, high ISO performance, HD movie capabilities, and Digic 4 image processor.  With these new upgrades, it might make it even more difficult to choose between them.  But there are some important differences.If you are considering the Rebel T3i vs T2i, the Rebel T3i is replacing the T2i.  Since both cameras share the same 18 megapixel sensor and Digic 4 processor, both the T2i and T3i will create images with exactly the same image quality, produce the same low light/ high ISO performance, shoot at 3.7 frames per second, and have nearly the same size and build quality.  They are both offered with the same 18-55mm kit lens (with some minor cosmetic differences on the new T3i kit lens).  The T3i is very slightly larger and heavier due to the addition of the rotating rear LCD monitor.  And that is one of the biggest differences between the two cameras.  Do you want and need a vari-angle rear screen or not?  The other major difference is the ability of the T3i to remotely control multiple off-camera flashes.  Like the 60D and 7D, you can use the built-in flash of the T3i to trigger other Canon Speedlites.  Some other minor additions to the T3i include the Scene Intelligent Auto Mode, which is a feature borrowed from point and shoot cameras.  When in Auto mode, the T3i will make a determination of what type of scene you are shooting - close-up, portrait, landscape, etc. - and automatically configure the camera settings accordingly.  However, if you want to use a powerful and costly digital SLR as a point and shoot, you should probably save the money and just buy a nice, high quality point and shoot like the Canon S95.  Other additional but not essential upgrades include the in-camera processing Creative Filters, and the ability to choose different image size ratios and to rate your images.  (Helpful hint: press the Q Button while in image playback and you can access features like rating, rotating, and Creative Filters.)  There is also a marginally helpful Feature Guide which gives brief descriptions of various settings and some additional video features like Video Snapshot, which you can use to shoot short video clips that are automatically joined together into a video, with music.Canon Rebel T3i  vs. 60D vs. 7DSensor and Image Quality:  All three cameras share a very similar sensor and 18 megapixels, and so their image quality will be virtually the same.  All are capable of taking professional quality images.Exposure Metering: The three cameras all share the latest 63-zone, dual-layer exposure metering system and 4 metering modes. That means they will all determine the exposure virtually identically and enable you to take properly exposed photos in most every situation, including difficult back-lit scenes. The size of the areas metered for Partial and Spot metering vary slightly between the cameras, but that isn't anything critical.Autofocus: The T3i shares a similar autofocus system to the 60D, with 9 focus points and three auto focusing modes. However the 9 AF points of the 60D are more sensitive than those of the T3i: all are cross-type in the 60D, only the center is cross-type in the T3i. The 60D autofocus system is much less complex than the sophisticated AF system of the 7D with its 19 AF point system and its additional Zone, Spot, and Expansion focus modes.  These various modes address how you want to deal with and group the numerous AF points.  Plus the custom settings of the 7D allow one to customize how the AF system works - how it tracks subjects, how it deals with objects that come between you and your initial subject, how quickly it responds to these changes of possible subjects that are at different distances from you, etc.  However, if you are not an avid sports photographer, a wildlife shooter, or someone who understands, needs, and will use the elaborate features of the 7D AF system, then this shouldn't sway you.Construction: As you can probably figure out from the prices, each camera is not built the same. The T3i has relatively strong construction of a stainless steel frame with polycarbonate body.  The 60D has a stronger and lighter aluminum frame and polycarbonate body, but not as strong as the 7D's magnesium alloy construction. The 60D also has some amount of weather sealing - more than the T3i, less than the 7D. But for most users, including even those using the camera daily or in travel situations, the construction of any of these cameras is far more than good enough, strong enough, and durable enough.ISO: Since they all share a very similar sensor, the ISO sensitivity and performance at high ISO settings is virtually the same for these three cameras. But don't take my word for it, don't be swayed by pixel peepers on forums, instead check out the camera sensor tests at dxomark to verify this.  As you can see, they all share the exact same overall score, and show very similar performance.Controls: As with construction, the buttons and controls vary with these cameras. Unlike the T3i, the 60D and 7D have nearly every control an advanced photographer needs on the exterior of the camera and they also have the top LCD panel and rear Quick Control Dial that are not on the T3i. With all the cameras, any controls can also be easily accessed with the Q Button and Q Menu or in the other menus on the rear LCD monitor. The top buttons of the 60D set only one setting each, so this is less complicated than the multiple-setting buttons of the 7D. Canon has removed the white balance (WB) button on the 60D that the 7D has, but that isn't a big deal - use the Q Menu. Another change on the 60D is that the Multi-controller has been moved from the thumb joystick like the 7D and 50D and placed in the middle of the rear Quick-control dial. This doesn't change how it functions, and should just be a matter of getting used to the difference.  If you plan on using your camera on Auto or Program most of the time, then the controls of the T3i are more than sufficient for your needs.  If you work in Av, Tv, or M modes and need quicker and more direct access to your controls and the additional top LCD screen to view and change your current settings, then you need to consider the 60D or 7D over the T3i.Menus and Custom Functions: These allow for greater control over customizing how the camera functions.  The T3i has less Menu and Custom Function setting options than the 60D, and the 7D has yet a few more than the 60D. These settings enable you to customize the operation, function, and controls to work how you want them to, including things like exposure increments, peripheral illuminations correction for lenses (fixes dark corners), tweaking how the autofocus system operates, setting more precise white balance settings, and customizing which button does what.  There are ebooks such as myCanon T3i Experience - The Still Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation With the Canon Rebel T3i / EOS 600DandYour World 60D - The Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Canon 60Dwhich walk you through all of the Menu settings and Custom Function settings so that you can set up your camera to work best for how you photograph, and also begin to learn to master all the advanced features, settings, and controls of these powerful dSLR camera.Wireless Flash: Like the 7D and 60D, the T3i incorporates wireless flash triggering. This allows you to trigger multiple off camera flashes at different output levels. The T2i does not have this feature.Articulating LCD Screen: The big new feature that the 60D and T3i have that the 7D and T2i do not is the articulating rear LCD screen. This may prove useful for videographers, as well as for setting up compositions while the camera is on a tripod, for macro use, or for using it from unusually low or high vantage points. Some users will be able to avoid buying an expensive angle finder because of this feature. There is also an electronic level in the 7D and 60D, visible in the viewfinder, rear LCD, or top LCD.Viewfinder: The T3i has a pentamirror viewfinder with 95% coverage of the actual resulting image.  The 60D has a large, bright pentaprism viewfinder with 96% coverage, not quite as nice as the nearly 100% view of the 7D pentaprism.Processor: The T3i shares the same Digic 4 processor as the 60D. The 7D has dual Digic 4 processors. However, if you don't need to shoot dozens of continuous images, you probably won't notice any processing speed issues.Continuous Shooting Speed: The T3i can shoot 3.7 frames per second.  The 7D can shoot a blazing 8 frames per second, in which the photos barely change from frame to frame.  The 60D can shoot a respectable 5.3 fps which is actually a more useful rate.  If you need the extremely high fps for sports, wildlife, or other action shooting, get the 7D.  If not, don't be swayed by this excessive feature.Memory Card: The T3i and 60D use the SD memory card.  The 7D uses the CF card.Battery: The T3i and T2i use the smaller LP-E8 battery with less capacity than the LP-E6 battery used by the 60D and 7D.Size and Weight: The T3i is smaller and lighter than the 60D, which in turn is smaller and lighter than the 7D.  Go to a store and hold them to get a better feel for their size, weight, and feel.  The 60D and 7D "feel" like the more substantial cameras that they are.  A nice improvement of the T3i is that its hand grip area has been modified, and has a different feel than that of the T2i - the area where the thumb rests is contoured differently and has a nice channel for the thumb, which allows for a much more secure one-hand-grip of the camera.AF Microadjustment: The 7D has this feature, the 60D and T3i and T2i do not.  This allows you to adjust the focus of each of your lenses in case any of them are slightly front-focusing or back-focusing.Locking Mode Dial: This is a new feature for a Canon dSLR, only on the 60D, that keeps the Mode dial from accidentally rotating. A nice touch.Full HD video: Of course they all offer this capability.  Note that this is not video for your kids' parties and soccer games.  It does not have continuous autofocus while shooting, as a camcorder does.  It is not designed for that kind of use, but rather for serious videographers who typically manually focus.  You can adjust autofocus while shooting by pressing the shutter button or the AF button, but it may have a less than desired looking result and unless you are using an external microphone, the autofocusing sound will be picked up.  The T3i has the digital zoom feature in video, which allows for nice smooth zooms while filming.Flash Sync: the 60D and T3i do not have a PC sync flash socket to plug in PC sync cords for off camera flash use.  The 7D has this.  However, they all offer wireless remote flash capability with the built in flash as a commander.Ease of operation: While beginners may find all the buttons, controls, and menus of any dSLR difficult and confusing at first, the menus and controls of the T3i and T2i are pretty basic and simple to learn for a dedicated user.  The additional controls and menus of the 7D and 60D are all quite intelligently designed, intuitive, and straightforward for the more advanced user.  Again, have a look at helpful guides such as myCanon T3i Experience - The Still Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation With the Canon Rebel T3i / EOS 600DandYour World 60D - The Photographer's Guide to Operation and Image Creation with the Canon 60Dto begin to learn to master all the advanced features, settings, and controls of these powerful dSLR cameras..

This, then, is a review from a mom/amateur's point of view.MY GOALS/EXPECTATIONS:I have always been a photo fiend, taking my camera everywhere and pulling it out at any opportunity. While I'd gotten to a decent level of archiving important moments with my point-and-shoot cameras over the years, I wanted to take my photography to the next level. I was inspired by my brother-in-law's photos of his kids to take the dSLR plunge. But I knew (and still know), very little about professional photography. I wanted to start taking better photos right away. But I also wanted to have room to grow as a photographer and a camera that would grow with me.I also wanted the focus to stay firmly on my family - while I was willing to invest some time and care into the camera, I didn't want it to become like a pet I had to constantly watch over. While any dSLR takes some care and consideration, I've found the T3i has been an excellent camera for me and I've been quite pleased with it.PROS:* VERY USER FRIENDLY: The auto mode (or auto without flash, my favorite) is highly forgiving, taking fantastically sharp images, true to color. They look so clear that I feel I'm capturing as close to real life as I've ever seen before in a camera.* FAST: While I sometimes go in for trying out new modes and manual settings, I often leave the camera in auto or auto-sans-flash mode and just click away so that I can at least capture a moment before it's gone. I then play with manual settings if my kids stay still long enough for me to try something new. My previous cameras always had a horrible delay for the autofocus (the only mode they usually had), meaning I nearly always lost the moment when the toddler was on the move. The t3i is so ridiculously fast that I can snap multiple pics in the time one picture took before.* BEAUTIFUL PICTURES: This kind of goes without saying at this tier of camera, but the pictures are just amazing quality. Coming from the land of point-and-shoot, I'm pretty blown away. And I know I'm only touching the tip of the iceberg for what's possible.* BEAUTIFUL VIDEO: This is the nice new feature of the t3i. I wasn't sure I'd want or need the HD video. But hey, when you've got it, you use it. I've gotten some amazingly clear footage of the kiddo playing in the park with daddy and I'm so glad we went for the model with that feature.* BIG, CLEAR DISPLAY: It's really easy to see what pics you've just taken and adjust your photo-taking accordingly. Just by seeing what I've gotten, I'm able to try again and improve a shot almost immediately.* CLEAR MENUS/ABILITY TO IMPROVE: The interface on this is so intuitive that I've been able to learn a lot without even cracking open the manual (though that manual is my new reading material). The entry point for a new user is just a step up from normal photography - the possibilities, however, are nearly endless.* NICE KIT LENS: For all that photographers get into new and better lenses, the kit lens on this is really nice and easy to use. I think it will hold us for a good long while before I get to be more of an expert. It gives me the range of zoom and focus I need for now.* EYE-FI COMPATIBLE: WOW. I cannot even tell you how much I love this feature. If you get an eye-fi card, your pictures can be set up to automatically upload to your computer whenever you are within range of your synched wireless network. My husband set up a SmugMug account and the eye-fi capabilities. I take pics to my heart's content while out on walks, in the park, etc., and come home, then leave the camera on (auto-shut off after 8 minutes) to upload the pics. I can then tag and sort pictures later at my leisure. For me, this is amazingly useful. I don't have to take time out of my day to upload the pics - the camera does that for me.* BATTERY LIFE (for common use): So far, the battery we bought for the camera lasts very well during normal photo-taking. It's just a standard Canon battery for the rebel line and it charges quickly. Even when taking pics like a mad-woman, it lasts through a shoot. HD video eats it up more quickly, so be warned. Still, I rarely run out of juice during the day so long as I pop the battery into its charger in the evening. However, uploading is another story (See below in cons).Those are just the first few things I love about this camera. Here, however, are the...not cons, really, just challenges:CHALLENGES:* dSLRs ARE EXPENSIVE, DELICATE, BIG AND BULKY:And parents have enough precious and delicate things to worry about - namely, the kids. No getting around it - you can't just toss a dSLR into a pocket and go. I'm in a quest for a good bag/carrying solution (heh, yeah, wish me luck with that.) and I'm trying to get used to having one part of my brain keeping an eye on the camera as well as keeping the majority of my focus on the kids. When I'm in photo-journalist mode, it's no problem, but switching back to mom-mode is the hard part. I've already seen the camera knocked onto the ground (a very short distance onto very soft ground, so it was okay, but still, the experience practically gave me a heart attack) and once, when bending over, I caught the toddler on the temple with the kit lens (She sobbed. I felt so awful!) This thing requires constant awareness to both the camera AND the kids when using it. I'm quickly adjusting, but if you're not totally committed to learning to use and love the dSLR, you may want to stick to really good point-and-shoot camera if you're a busy parent.^ That's the big one.* BATTERY LIFE (when uploading pics via eye-fi): Uploading pictures by eye-fi seems to eat the battery alive. It appears that the camera won't autoshutoff when uploading, so this morning, after a few hours of uploading big, glorious pictures to my SmugMug account, the battery finally ran out of juice. I wish there was a plug-in mode or some sort of docking-station I could plug the camera into when I return home. If it's only a few pics, they upload and the camera shuts itself off. But if it's a bunch of pics (and when the weather's nice and the lighting's good, I take a lot of pics), the camera requires a battery recharge just to finish uploading my pictures.* SWIVEL SCREEN WORRIES: I find that the swivel screen, while hugely useful, is something I constantly worry that I'm going to snap off. However, you can keep it closed with the screen facing in(a nice feature) or tuck it onto the camera with the screen facing out. I also find if I'm looking out of the eye-piece, I leave cheek smudges all over the screen when its facing out.* MANUAL-MODE GOOFS: Some of my manual mode forays have been less than stellar. I've taken a shot - set up so nice, focus just perfect, subject just so... only to find out I left it in white-balance adjustment for indoors and I was outdoors so the whole picture looks like I dipped it in blue. I've learned to take pics in auto-mode first before experimenting too much. I also learned to check the screen a LOT before proceeding.SUMMARY: While the dSLR has required me to make some adjustments for including it in my busy life, I really love this camera, am pleased with the investment, am inspired by its ease of use, and I LOVE the pictures I've gotten of my family.5 STARS: And so I give it 5 stars - my whole point in buying a nice camera was to make and preserve FAMILY memories - and the t3i records those memories beautifully - in .jpg, raw, or HD video - with a minimum of dSLR fuss.*** UPDATE: about 6 months later ***STILL AWESOME:  I totally stand by the above review. If anything, I've come to adore this camera even more than I did when we first got it. When baby #2 arrived, the quality of pictures that we got far surpassed the pictures from the first baby's photo shoots. I'm truly pleased with this investment, as the pictures we get are lovely, clear, true-to-light/true-to-color, and just capture the memories so well. Really, this is EXACTLY what I was hoping for as an amateur photographer/mom.GOT BETTER:Battery Woes: We invested in an A/C adapter for the camera and now no longer eat the battery alive when leaving the camera to upload pictures via the Eye-Fi connection. It's a little annoying to have to swap over to the A/C and then back to a battery all the time - I would rather have a charging station of sorts - but it works and it means I stick the battery in the charger so it's almost always ready to go.Ease of Use: I adjusted to using this thing pretty quickly. I invested in a LowePro FastPack 250 and it works nicely as a diaper-bag/day bag/camera bag. Not the most attractive purse, but it works well. I'm much better at being ready for any photo situation now.Swivel Screen: No problems to report. I just leave it screen out all the time.SAME: Awesome camera all around. Truly, truly impressive. There might be higher tiers of quality out there, but for what I use in following the kids around, this captures amazing shots quickly. Love it.GOT (just a little) WORSE:Eye-Fi Annoyance: This is going to differ from person to person, but our Eye-Fi stuff has had some kinks to work out. The card we bought required several updates lately, then we had to change SmugMug account stuff, but the changed password meant Eye-Fi couldn't upload. Blah, blah, blah, I'm sure most of the problem is ME not getting the changes my hubby made. Still, Eye-Fi is usually automatic, but from time to time, it requires maintenance and understanding from all parties uploading stuff. Just be warned, it isn't so automagical as I hoped it would be.Getting used to the dSLR bulk: I'd be lying if I said the size of the camera wasn't occasionally an issue. There have been quite a few times I think, "Oh, where's the camera? That's right, I left it at home/in the car because it's kind of a pain to pack around." On many occasions, the hubby's phone camera stood in for us (and it takes pretty decent pictures, so it's okay). But if I'm not being really deliberate about bringing the dSLR and using it, this camera becomes a very expensive toy that I never play with.Other than that ^ though, awesome camera. I'm truly loving it. On the whole, a Lotta camera for Low maintenance..

I took it on a trip and it worked great. I used to have a 35mm SLR and the I have a point-and-shoot digital camera and this is the best of both worlds. The quality of the pictures is just great. Also it is good for action pictures like sports or still pictures from a moving vehicle. If I have to say something bad is that sometimes it takes its time to decide when to shoot. I only have it for about 4 weeks and I already took more than 1200 pictures. I only used the video for a short time (maybe 15 minutes of video) and it did a good job. I am a still photo person more than a video. The telephoto is very good too. Depending on needs and budget I recommend this camera for the amateur photographers who wants to spend less than 1K and wants to get good results. Additional hood lens are a plus to reduce glare and I recommend a 32Gb memory card if you are planning to take video. Another recommendation is to read the manual and practice all the different options if you are not familiar with DSLR cameras..

The master flash then does not effect the photo image, but the Neewer, and, I suppose most other speedlights, will pick up the signal and flash.  Great idea, and it works.The only downer is the velvet bag.  Whose bone headed idea was that?  Will go to various retail outlets looking for a zippered, PADDED bag to fit this.  At $42, I can afford a bag.I have set up a kludge studio in a spare bedroom to learn digital cameras and lighting effects.  Styrofoam panels for reflectors, old sheets for backdrops, incandescent lights (with white balance adjusted for it in the camera) and this speedlight.  Stepladder for a stand for it.  Styrofoam head from a craft shop, painted with cheap acrylic, and a rescued tripod with homemade trigger for hands-free operation of a sophisticated point and shoot with a lot of DSLR features.  All that, and a good &#34;for Dummies&#34; book frm the library.The Neewer is really important to all this, and has all the features I need for it, with no features I don't need.  Seems to be the best bang for the buck out there for a beginner.Read those reviews before buying.  Read both the one star and the five star.

For that you're going to have to spend way more than the $40 or so this unit costs. Also, like all speedlights, the power is nowhere near that of studio strobes. The power levels are brain-dead easy to set, however. The optical strobe functions work well - I connect one speedlight with a remote trigger and set the other two to fire optically.

On the Canon the built-in flash does not pop up as it seems the camera knows that there is something connect to the hot-shoe. However, the Neewer fires only when using the viewfinder. If I use the LCD display of Canon it does not fire and this may be due to Canon design. Also both cameras do not recognize the flash type so you can not control any settings from the camera itself.

Less than $40 buck for a flash that works! I tested this on both the Nikon D80 and D700 and it works on both of them (no surprise here). I will be using this as a manual flash so I don't care about all the features that it's missing. All the modes works (manual, S1, and S2). S1 and S2 modes are for remote trigger using your other main flash. S2 is for triggering this flash when you set your main flash to TTL. The power of this flash is very decent. The control is very easy to operate. The cycle time seem pretty good-no problem here. By the way, the foot is metal and not plastic. The flash is not noisy like some of the people said-it sounds like my other Nikon flash.  The only not-so-good thing is that it's harder to rotate the head down. Rotating the head side-way and upward is smooth. The battery door locking mechanism seem inadequate. Just don't drop the flash, and the batteries won't fall out. Overall, for the money I paid, this flash is awesome. I was thinking about getting the SB-910, but this flash will delay that purchase for quite awhile. Buy it if you find it for $40.

I do not know about other camera systems :)2. Manual flash: not auto flash or not a TTl flash, it means that : camera settings and this TT560 are the sun and the moon.

Pretty much just manual and slave modes. With the manual power you have to look in the user guide to see which power you are at (ie. 1/1, 1/2, 1/4). It is no where near as powerful as its Canon counterpart. When you turn it on it does not make that charging up sound nor does it "pop" when you flash. Just very weak. As far as it being cheap... well you get what you pay for. It is very light, the flash head turns and moves very hard (you feel like your going to break it), and it says in the manual not to flash it at full power more than 20 times cause it will over heat. Then you have to let it "cool down" for ten minutes. My canon speedlight could get through an entire wedding and never even get warm.Yes I know, the flash is less than $50, but I'm just pointing out some stuff for people thinking this will be exactly like a canon flash just with a different brand name on it.

HOWEVER, the guide number is not correct. I measured f/3.5 @ 5 meters, which calculates to a GN of 17.5. Even assuming my light meter is off by 1/3 a stop, that means a maximum GN of 20. I'm guessing that when Neewer tested this, they determined guide number in a room with either (1.) walls reflecting flash light that artificially boosted the GN, or (2.) ambient light was accidentally introduced to their test. As a control, I get within +/- 5 GN for the Canon 600EX-RT, +/- 3 GN on the Canon MR-14EX, and +/- 10 GN on my 500W monolights. The margin of error should be somewhere in the realm of 4 GN.

Take it to lightroom and smoothen it and sharpen it.... and there you go. My family loves me, and every occasion is one where everyone ends up getting a professional looking pic.The trick in using this flash is to first get set the camera to an underexposure of about two stops. Then set the flash power to the middle of the range. Now this is for a photo taken about 4 to 5 feet away from the subject. Here you can use either direct or bounce. With bounce you'll get softer light as you probably know. And that's it.So what you need to know as a buyer is that - this flash works, does what it is supposed to do, and does it for real cheap. as someone else said it one here, light is light, no matter where it comes from, i.e. a 500 dollar speedlight or a 50 dolar flash. and that's all you need to know.

Examples include hard drive failures, broken keypads, and digital camera sensor failures. Your item is covered for up to its full replacement cost, excluding tax & shipping.&#34;Here is an exerpt of what the plan doesn't cover: &#34;Accidental Damage: Unless you purchase ADH coverage, we don't cover items that are damaged accidentally. This includes water immersion, drops, and spills.&#34;So I may be confused here, but isn't an accidental damage plan supposed to cover accidental damage???Another complaint I have is that they never sent me the warranty. They say on the site that they will not send a hard copy, which is fine, but what good is it if they don't send an electronic copy either?  I literally had to file a claim with them in order to get my electronic copy.I gave it a decent rating because it does have some protection value, but it doesn't protect what the name of the warranty claims.

What a relief because although the phone is over a year old it is typical Samsung top notch quality.We had a Barnes and Noble brand Nook e-reader (first generation, original model) and sold that to a co-worker this year when we upgraded to this 7Plus Tablet.  Again, Square Trade was very easy to contact for instructions via phone plus they followed up on email providing steps on how to transfer my 3 year warranty with Accidental Protection along with the Nook.  Who does that?  My co-worker loves his Nook and although he has had no issues with the unit it is an added benefit knowing there is full warranty coverage in case anything happens.The TV warranty was purchased at Costco and this too offers great benefits, extending the factory warranty plus the Costco 2nd year coverage.  The TV is covered for 5 years as a result and for less than $50!!!!  Try buying a new LED HDTV warranty at Best Buy or Sears, it costs a fortune!  The benefit of Square Trade's policy?  It including electrical damage coverage and in-home servicing although if it were a smaller unit, Square Trade provides the full shipping boxes and labels to send it in for inspection and repairs (they provide in-home repairs if the TV is 37"or larger).  It's a no-brainer!I find their web site very easy to work with, they have very polite and professional folks that call you back to explain how to transfer your policy or to trouble shoot problems with your smartphone or other electronic.My experiences dealing with Square Trade over the past three years have all been positive, and I have zero regrets or negative comments.

Problem is my amazon email address and squaretrade email address are not the same.I sent an email asking for it to be changed. NO response. I then called and talked to a person that seemed to have his own agenda for the service call. It took me over 30 minutes to finally direct the persons attention from changing my existing account squaretrade email address to my amazon email address. But instead to change the new warranty contract address to my squaretrade account email address.The person made way to hard. Then when he was &#34;done&#34;, I checked the account and it still does not show the new warranty. What damage has been done I do not know, will my existing warranties now simply disappear. I have no idea.Given the amount of difficulty I had with the service rep, amazon should have a query button asking if the email account of the squaretrade warranty is the same email address the purchase is being made. If not ask for the correct email address and file it with squaretrade. Completely eliminating the hassle I went through.But what I do know is from now on, it will be a very cold day indeed before I will buy another squaretrade warranty through amazon.

It feels more like a computer kangaroo pouch than a sleeve.The case itself seems to be made well.  I will consider getting one for my wife's laptop.Obviously, I wouldn't drop a star just because it is a generic size.  But I thought it was a little misleading that the manufacturer claims that the 16" sleeve will work for a 15.4" screen. You think you would only have 1/2" of wiggle room (normal).  So it's a bit frustrating they don't have one that fits a Macbook Pro Retina 15.4" well.So just know that the 16" is really probably better for a 16" edge-to-edge computer, if not a little more, if you are looking for snugness..

Most cases seem to be designed for 15 or 16 inch notebooks.  On the other end of the spectrum, cases are designed for 10 inch netbooks.  Neither was well suited for the Air's svelt but unusual size. It sits right in the middle in a gulf between these two primary case sizes. That's why I was so pleased to see Case Logic come out with a product specifically designed for the MacBook Air and similar sized devices.I'm happy to say that tte Case Logic LAPS-113 doesn't disappoint. It fits the larger size MacBook Air like a glove and would probably work as well for any similar sized Mac or PC notebook.A word of caution, though. This product is a sleeve, not a case. It is intended for slipping a notebook into it for protecton and transport. As such there are pockets or holders for mice, USB devices, cables or power supplies. if you need that capability then you will need to look elsewhere.

I think this screen protector can be lifetime. The only thing is I took it off after a good 8 months of use. I kind of regret because there were no scratch or damage. I got a new screen for my phone and I regret it. The quality of it is nothing like ArmorSuit. With ArmorSuit on my phone, the touch screen still works great, even more sensitive I think. It makes my screen feels like a gel. It feels like it is protected by an invisible thin layer of gel.

The great thing is, I was able to return it and get my money back - no questions asked. So, if you're thinking about trying this but wonder if it will work with your stylus, I'd say give it a go (and if it DOES work with your stylus, perhaps write a review and let others know what stylus you use?) because at the very least, if it doesn't work, they will refund your money quickly (and you don't have to pay for shipping to send it back).I've just decided to go the naked route because it's just easier with my styluses and I don't feel like trying more shields.Good luck!.

When the squeegee removes the liquid, which it is designed to do, spay some more on the outside.  D not squeegee without plenty of liquid lubricating the exterior side of the shield. This keeps the squeegee from making and scuff marks on the surface of the shield.This company's customer service is amazing.  They proactively follow up with you to make sure you are totally satisfied.  When I mentioned the small issue I had, they quickly sent me a brand new protector to make sure I was 100% satisfied.

If this is your experience, read on as THIS IS THE BEST SCREEN PROTECTOR BRAND I HAVE EVER USED (I've used several and even left positive feedback for one).ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS & TIPS (Beyond the instructions that come with this product)I followed the provided instructions very closely because I've installed other screen protectors in the past and know that if you get lint or dust or air bubbles under the screen protector while installing it, it can be very difficult to get them out.1. First I cleaned my screen with a lint free, 3-M MicroFiber cloth (probably overkill for this product and you'll be just fine with the included install tools, but the same can't be said for other manufacturer's screen protectors, and this was my first time with ArmorSuit)2. Next I followed ArmorSuit's instructions and lightly sprayed my iPad screen, my finger tips and the outer surface of the new screen protector with the included spray solution.3. Then I carefully peeled the screen protector off of its paper backing and sprayed the adhesive side as per the included instructions.4. At this point I made the ArmorSuit into a "U" shape, placed the lower curve near the center of my iPad screen, and pressing down gently I let it unroll toward the edges of my iPad.5. NOTE: at this point my experience was similar to other manufacturer's screen protector installs so I was making every effort to avoid air bubbles and to get things aligned with the edges, camera, and "home" button on my iPad.6. **TIP**: In the past, carrying an older iPad from the car to the office in the rain, a small amount of water managed to get into the audio buttons and they never worked again.  So I was EXTREMELY careful about getting any of the spray solution into any of the exposed openings on the iPad (like the mic, home button, power button, sim card slot, mute, and volume buttons.  To do this I used a lint free, moisture absorbent towel and propping the iPad on its audio buttons edge I squeegeed out the spray solution starting from the center of the screen to remove any bubbles as I went, while pausing to immediately dab up and absorb any water that was getting near any of the openings or buttons while squeegeeing.  It was not hard to do this while squeegeeing, but may have been challenging or introduced lint and/or dust if I wasn't prepared to do this from the start.My recommendation would be to have a lint free towel ready for this purpose BEFORE you start.==== WHERE THE ARMORSUIT INSTALL EXPERIENCE BECAME QUITE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER SCREEN PROTECTOR INSTALLS ====7. At this point if you've done everything correctly you're usually done with a typical screen protector install.  Assuming this, I looked at my screen, and seeing no air bubbles or lint I thought I'd done a decent job, BUT...**** it looked TERRIBLE!!!! ****So, bad that I almost peeled it off to start over or throw the ArmorSuit away.  DON'T GIVE UP!  READ ON...OBSERVATIONS AT THIS POINT (so you can compare to your own experience and maybe decide to "hang in there")7a. About 75% of my screen looked pretty good (no bubbles, sort of clear).  The remaining 25% had what appeared to be adhesive residue from where I'd lifted, and slightly pivoted/twisted the ArmorSuit during install to get it positioned correctly.7b. I thought maybe I could squeegee this adhesive looking residue out, so I squeegeed some more, and a bit more firmly.  It made no difference other than to add what seemed to be surface scratches to the ArmorSuit and to stretch the soft plastic of the ArmorSuit and give it what I now thought were going to be permanent surface scratches from the squeegee.7c. Pretty sure at this point that it was a lost cause, I was going to pull it off and throw it away, so I went against the instructions and turned my iPad on to see how it looked.***Even the 75% of the screen that looked decent when the iPad was off looked TERRIBLE! ***It had fuzzy text and was distorted (I assume because the spray solution was still drying).  But the worst part was the adhesive areas -- they were still noticeable even with the bright screen being on!7d. PRIDE KICKED IN... I remembered that over 1000 people had given this product good feedback on Amazon so I re-read the instructions, saw that it said to leave the iPad OFF and to wait at least 12 hours.  I figured if over 1000 people had had a better experience then maybe the problem was me, so I opted to wait it out for the remaining 11 hours and 55 minutes.*** 5 HOURS LATER ***8. I'd left my iPad off for about 5 hours, but then happened to plug it in.  Doing so, the screen came on for a few seconds and I was pleased to see that the "fuzzy" text I mentioned earlier had disappeared and the residue areas were somewhat less noticeable.*** 14 HOURS LATER ***9. Having managed to be otherwise occupied I came back to my iPad about 14 hours later expecting to have to make a decision about peeling the screen protector off and buying a different product.  I could not have been more surprised...During the 14 hours the screen had "healed".  It no longer had the surface scratches near the "adhesive residue" areas that I'd attempted to squeegee away the day before.  The "residue" was also completely invisible too.FINAL OBSERVATIONSThe screen protector itself that I thought had felt a little too "soft" the day before now felt hard and much more "smooth" and "slippery" to the touch.  It wasn't as slick as a bare, unprotected screen, but hey, its now protected from scratches and dings so to me, it is a worthwhile trade off.  Compared to other manufacturer's screen protectors, the ArmorSuit is clear, and still has a decent, slippery feel for those precise, light gestures.I know this was a long review to read, but if your install experience turns out to be at all like mine, the advised, lengthy wait recommended in the instructions where you should leave your device OFF and not use the screen so the spray solution can dry and the ArmorSuit can do its "self-healing" thing is well worth paying attention to.  Patience pays off.CONCLUSIONSAfter initially installing the ArmorSuit, I was ready to pull it off and throw it away based on my experience with other products, but I am VERY glad I followed the instructions and waited at least 12 hours before using my iPad to give the ArmorSuit time to dry in place and harden.  I only wish I had taken "before" and "after" photos to show you because if you end up with a screen that looks as bad as mine at the initial application step, you might be tempted to give up too, but if you could see my before and after photos you'd agree that its probably worth waiting.Good luck!.

There were some spots that would not go away.VERY IMPORTANT :-Be patient and Be willing to give it 24 hours. Within 24 hours my screen was 99% perfect and then within the next few days perfect.It worked beautifully.Now for the product itself. I have had no issues using it with the ipad. I really like there is some feel and resistance to it.

I had a Pioneer SC27 but I just couldn't find it better than my old Harman in terms of sound. The Harman was lacking connections to be able to stream from my computer. The AudioEngine was great to be honest but it was almost 3x the price of this Logitech adapter and with the AudioEngine I needed plug in power to handle the receiver portion of the set and a powered USB for the transmitter. With the Logitech, still need power but it is only for the device and it sits neatly on top of the receiver or wherever you would choose to place it. Still uses RCA connections to the Receiver. Now I can stream from my computer or my cell phone and the sound is very clear. Is it a true audiophile unit, no. There is a "liveliness" missing from Bluetooth technology, not this units fault. I am very happy with the sound quality, highs and bass. Definitely a "must buy" if you are in love with your older amplifier and haven't decided to spend thousands on a new fully integrated receiver.

The flashing green light on the Logitech then goes to a continuous green light and you are set to go.One advantage of the Logitech over similar products is that the Logitech provides left and right RCA stereo females as well as a 3.5 mm stereo female.  I used the RCA females to connect to my stereo receiver and I used the 3.5 mm female, with a splitter, to connect to the Auxiliary inputs on our two bedside Grace Mondo internet radios.I am sorry to say, although we still like our Mondos, we finally got fed up with their inconsistent wi-fi acquisition and their constant interruption and re-buffering of radio station signals.  Our iPad sits on my nightstand right beside one of the Mondos and it NEVER has problems acquiring and holding onto the same radio stations.  Now we just set our morning alarms on the Mondos to "Aux" and our preferred radio station comes on immediately, with no endless reconnecting and buffering..

Being a little tech savvy helps you use this little device; not being tech savvy is asking for trouble.  Recommended!Background:  I've had this device around the house for weeks now, but only tonight was I able to use it.  Why?  My teenaged son absconded this Logitech Bluetooth audio adapter so he could use it with his iPod Touch.  The upside?  He showed me how to quickly set up this device on my laptop tonight, which for me involved finding the right Bluetooth driver from Dell's website and loading it onto my laptop before I could begin using this little wonder.What I LIKE:- Assuming you've got Bluetooth drivers working properly on your computer, hooking up this Logitech adapter was simple to do.  You must know how to set your computer's Bluetooth settings to be in discovery mode firstly, before you can connect the Logitech adapter wirelessly to your computer (this is where being tech savvy comes into play).  Once your computer is in discovery mode, enter '0000' for the passcode when you first dock the Logitech adapter with your computer.  Allow the Logitech drivers to load on your computer, and you're almost done.  You also have to know how to direct audio output from your computer to the Bluetooth audio output, too.  Again, being a little tech savvy makes this a snap -- but if you're not, you may struggle a bit to figure this out.- It works!  Once connected, the Logitech adapter received my computer's audio signal wirelessly, allowing me to play music to amplified speakers connected to the Logitech adapter.  You can either connect speakers with a built-in amplifier, or you can connect this to your home stereo using RCA red/white jacks.- I like being able to wirelessly play music through my old stereo receiver using Windows Media Player on my laptop.- Having it connected to our home stereo allows different family members to play music through the stereo using different Bluetooth-enabled devices (iPods, laptops, Bluetooth phones, etc.).- You can connect this adapter either with RCA jacks or a 3.5mm jack (we have a portable, amplified speaker that connects via 3.5mm)- The red/green indicator on the Logitech's front panel makes it easy to know whether it's connected and communicating with another Bluetooth device.What Could Be BETTER:- My teenaged son is the one who read the manual; I just took instruction from my son when setting this up on my laptop.  My son said that the manual wasn't very helpful, and that he had to do some Google searches to figure out a few things (like, entering '0000' for the passcode during the initial docking).- The effective range wasn't that great in our home environment.  If we move out of the same area as where our stereo is (where this Logitech adapter is connected), the music stops playing.  You pretty much have to be in the same room with your wireless device if you want to play uninterrupted music through this Logitech adapter.- Bluetooth technology can be great when it's working, but it can become a black hole of time when it's not.  I didn't have any trouble tonight setting up my laptop to work with this Logitech adapter, but I've found Bluetooth to be finicky.Conclusion:  If you are a techie kind of audiophile, or someone in your home is technically inclined, then this may be a handy little device to have, especially if you want to stream music to a non-Bluetooth-enabled stereo system.  For all others, go slow before you buy this or any other Bluetooth device..

This nifty little gadget allows me to do so without any wires!Getting it to pair was a somewhat hit and miss proposition. It took a bit of fiddling, and the instructions aren't the greatest. I think what I decided was that if you hold the button down for a long time (&#62;10 seconds), it seems to delete any stored parings and start fresh. The (lousy) instructions didn't mention it though and I never fully confirmed this to be true though so I may be mistaken.Most of my complaints are probably more a problem with the Bluetooth devices I was trying to connect to it. With the Surface tablets (we also used my wife's Surface RT), there is no way to disconnect from the receiver without either uninstalling the driver or the aforementioned &#34;hold the button down until it deletes all the pairings&#34; trick. Neither are very convenient. If you leave it paired, it will reconnect any time you walk within range and you will suddenly lose sound to the built in speakers. The first time it happened, it took me a while to figure out what was going on since the stereo was turned off at the time and I had no sound at all.The other complaint is the volume just isn't that high. I almost feel like I need to get a pre-amp for it. I don't know if it is because the output levels of the Surface tablets are low, or if the output from the receiver is low. At any rate, even having the volume all the way up on the stereo wasn't unbearably loud.Others have complained of problems with it ceasing to function, but so far I haven't run in to that problem. Basically if you can't get it to pair up, delete the driver/device from the Bluetooth settings and let it create a new one.In summary, it serves the purpose intended. We were able to pair it with both tablets with only minimal fuss, although of course only one can be connected at a time. The output levels could be higher, but the quality is good. I'll ding them one star for the weak instructions, low output levels, and inconvenient means of detaching from the transmitting device..

All pairs were made with minimal effort, and they all sounded great.  I don't get the greatest range over bluetooth, but it seems to be a function of both the Logitech receiver and the device communicating with it.All in all, it's a great device that does what it should.

I was able to immediately pair it with an Android 4.1 smartphone, an old iPhone 3G, and also a recent Macbook running on Mountain Lion.  Wisely, it doesn't auto-connect when it gets in range; you have to deliberately select it on your phone or computer.Range is as expected.  I'd guess a max of 30 feet is reasonable if there are no walls but multiple walls nearby won't block the signal either.  If you have difficulty with Bluetooth range you might want to consider how many Wifi networks are nearby since as few as three active ones on equally-spaced channels can cover the whole band that is used by both Bluetooth and 2.4 GHZ Wifi.Of course you still need an amplifier and speakers, but this comes with a power supply and a cord that's 1/8-mini stereo plug to White/Red RCA plugs.  Whether your amplifier takes 1/8-mini stereo or RCA input you can reverse the cable to match it since this adapter has both types of output jacks.I'd give it 5 stars if it was a little cheaper.

The range is excellent, it can easily stream through up to 2  thick walls. This is a lot better than the Homespot bluetooth adapter that I bought (short range , kept on disconnecting) Now, let's be clear , bluetooth  uses compression for streaming, so the quality of audio will never be 100% identical to a hard wired connection. The truth is with this adapter, the integrity of the audio is well preserved. I have yet to find any distortion . Another thing to keep in mind is you can only have one connected device at a time. You must turn off the bluetooth off on your phone in order to use the computer , just an example.  The good news is the new model lift that restriction.(You still cannot stream from 2 sources at the same time, but you don't have to disconnect and reconnect each time you switch devices.Just stop streaming in one and resume on your other device)http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Bluetooth-Adapter-Streaming-Speakers/dp/B00IQBSW28/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1402459700&sr;=8-4&keywords;=logitech+bluetooth+adapterThis is a link to the new version , I also bought it.

Within a couple of minutes I was ready to go. Easy & simple. I can use this all day with any of my bluetooth devices and not worry about anything. Flawless transmission of sound.-Design: This sits next to my iMac on my desktop and looks great. It almost has a Apple kind of design to it with its simplicity. Reminds me a lot of the Apple TV. Also, its small enough that it stays out of the way.Cons:-The range of the device is lacking. I have a medium sized bedroom and once I step out of it, it starts to lose connection. I have heard from other reviewers that this is because of the metal plate on the bottom of the device. This sounds correct to me but I am not willing to mod the device myself to adjust the range. If your like me, I only use this device in my bedroom so its perfect for what I need.Overall, I would say this purchase was worth every penny.

It's just great.Cons:  Range could be better but I don't expect much from bluetooth.  Bluetooth was designed to be a personal area network, not a contender to wifi.  Starts to hiccup a bit with one wall and the distance exceeds 10-15 feet.  Granted, my arrangement puts the kitchen appliances in between which are large metal signal blockers.

Motorola had a sticker on the side of the modem with the MAC ID, and several stickers in the box with the same info - to place on the computers around your home, I guess - in case you ever had to call your internet provider.I spent about 15 minutes on hold with Comcast to get to a real person.  Their tech rep was very pleasant and helpful.  She walked me through the steps.  Basically, all I had to do was turn off my router.  My computer, a 2011 Apple iMac, was plugged into a wireless router, that was in turn plugged into the new modem.  Comcast found my modem and activated it.  I didn't even have to unplug from the router and connect directly modem to computer.  Once I got to a person at Comcast, it took about 10 minutes.  They told me were to drop off the old modem so the rental could be taken off my bill.Speed tests prior to swapping modems averaged 10 to 15 Mbps for downloads.  After installing the SB 6121, download speed improved to 35 Mbps.  Uploads now come in at about 5.5 Mbps.Some users mention the SB6121 modem getting warm.

My older SB5101U cable modem, which is DOCSIS 2.0 and working perfectly, is no longer supported by Comcast and hasn't been for sometime. I was starting to get harassing 'phone calls from Comcast about continuing to use de-supported equipment and the speed limitations that come with doing so. Shouldn't that be MY choice? I used Comcast's website to determine which DOCSIS 3.0 modems they support and based on other Amazon reviews, picked the SB6121. As I said, my prior SB5101U had been rock solid from day one and 3 years down the road was still working just fine.The installation of the SB6121 was simple enough. Simply disconnect the old modem, connect the new one in the same fashion, then call Comcast to have them activate it. Comcast need 3 things. (1) Make/model of the new modem. (2) The modem serial number. You'll find it on the box, labeled as "S/N. It's the massively long number, NOT the shorter "CUSTOMER S/N". (3) The HFC MAC ID. This too is on the box and is NOT the Ethernet MAC address. You can also get this information by logging into the modem itself by using a browser and going to address 192.168.100.1. Once there, click on Addresses and it'll display this information. If you use a router/switch, then make sure you connect the modem directly to your computer for the activation. You can re-connect everything back via your router/switch once Comcast have done their thing. Note, the activation does take several minutes and you may have to reboot the modem to get it to talk to Comcast. A wise (wo)man will keep the Comcast tech on the line while this happens. If you don't and there's a problem, then you'll have to call Comcast back and go to the back of the queue. I was on hold for almost 25 minutes waiting to speak to someone about modem activation. Apparently Comcast were having an "unusually heavy call volume", hence the wait. Seems they have an unusually heavy call volume every time I need to call them. I wonder why? Answers on a postcard to 'We Mostly Don't Know What We're Doing', Comcast HQ, Philadelphia, PA, 19103-2838.Once you're up and running with your new modem, the fun can resume. Before I swapped out my SB5101U, I ran a speed test multiple times using speakeasy.net. My averages were 29.28 MB/s down and 11.78 MB/s up. With the new SB6121 in play, my averages were 76.85 MB/s down and 12.13 MB/s up. Seems Comcast were right about the speed limitations of my older SB5101U, although I have reason to believe they downgrade the speed for modems connected to their network which they no longer support. That's a different issue outside of this review.Overall, very satisfied with this piece of equipment. If it continues to perform as well as my previous SB5101U I'll be very happy. Recommended..

Some cable providers may not need the information, but my cable provider (Cox) required the Customer Number (Customer S/N on the box) and HFC MAC ID. (I also have to give Cox Customer Service a thumbs up for making it easy to set up the modem.)The box contains the modem, power cord/adapter, and a short CAT 5 cable. Installation is easy - hook co-ax cable from your wall to the modem, the CAT 5 cable from the modem to your computer or router, hook up the power, and call your cable provider. I would also recommend restarting your computer once you have the cable modem installed - especially if you are not using a router. Motorola's instructions are excellent and they do mention contacting your cable provider.I thought Amazon's price was excellent - certainly much cheaper than purchasing this modem from Cox (I think Cox wanted $130 for a similar modem) and much better than renting a modem for $7.00/month.

You can, however, purchase your own cable modem and save money month-to-month. The cable company had a list of compatible modems, based off the speed I was getting and after comparing the price here and the monthly rental fee from the cable company, it would be more affordable to buy this modem (7 months of rental fees at time of purchase).As for the modem itself - installation was very easy. I opted to self-install to avoid the install fee from the cable company (roughly forty dollars) and quickly realized that this modem does not come with a coax cable. Not an issue for most people, but one that required me to make another run to a local store to get a cable. If you buy this, make sure you get a coax cable as well. When I contacted the cable company to get this modem registered on their network, I had to read out the S/N and model number. It took about 30 minutes for it to go active, but it worked fine since then. NOTE: the cable company has to verify your home is eligible for self install (previous owner/renter had same cable service), else they must send someone out.This modem only allows for direct, wired connection. The modems that include wifi capability generally have issues with both the cable signal and the wifi signal. When you try to add too many things to one device, they all seem to suffer. I would recommend buying this device and then getting a stand-alone wifi router - your signal strength will thank me.Overall, the installation was painless, the cost was far less than monthly rent from the cable company, and thus far I am getting the exact speed I paid for. If the box came with a 3ft coax cable, it would be perfect - but even without it, it does what it is supposed to do..

For the record I also bought a wireless Router to stop renting that also. And I don't know if it's just because I got new equipment but my speeds are  top-of-the-line. Before I change modem and router my speeds vary greatly on a Windows based PC or Safari based iPad.

This will be JUST the serial number, not the "customer serial number".4.  Make sure your LAN connection has DHCP turned on (should be on by default, but make sure, as you can't google it once you're offline of course.)First about the modem, prior to plugging or unplugging anything...  to connect this you need to call/IM/chat with Comcast to have them enter the MAC and SN into the system on their side and then a billing person will add the new modem to your account and list if for $0.00.  Once that's all clear you may connect the modem - make sure you power down the existing modem, so your laptop does not attempt to connect to the old wifi.Then you must FIRST connect the modem **directly** to the PC (DHCP enabled on pc) and allow it connect.  Launch your browser and despite your previous discussion with them, you will likely need to 'activate' your service.  Enter your login info (failed for me) or your previously noted account number and phone number.  It will tell you that it takes up to 45 minutes, really it's under 20, hit 'continue' as prompted.NEXT PART IS KEY:  It may now tell you it's updating the software on your modem and that you're modem will reboot itself, it may not reboot.  Keep testing internet on a new tab and after a few minutes you'll be online.  You don't really need to reboot.Now, to connect the TP Link router, plug in the modem into the WAN port on the router, then plug your pc into another port.  At this point you WILL NOT have internet access.  You can however go to the router IP 192.168.0.1, admin, admin.  Now FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS in the box for the TP Link router, with Comcast/xfinity you must hit the button to clone the mac address of your PC over to the router (as outlined in the router instructions - there are a few sheets, this will be a separate pamphlet), as apparently Comcast locks the modem to a single device IP upon activation.  (You may also want to configure your router and wifi password while you're in the settings.  Bookmark the settings page)At this point you may or may not have to power cycle your devices.  That's it, you should be up and running.Summary:Connect Modem to PC direct, activate serviceConnect modem to router, router to PCChange router setting to clone MAC address.Reboot devices, enjoy.Pay Comcast too much money for poor service.

One annoyance is that the lights on the front panel are way too bright, even for use in the living room.

This is thus far a fine little machine with simple installation; the only improvement that the documentation could use (I'm a tech writer) is that they fail to mention what wireless users should do in terms of order of events. Before I even attempted installation, I called Motorola support for some best practice information; I was told to first connect the new modem to the computer itself before attempting the wireless portion of connectivity. I did that, received the Comcast registration page, and that's where things got hung up as you have to provide Comcast with your MAC ID number (which involves contacting a human being--an act of Congress that you must get passed but it can be done with patience). From there: a breeze. After getting that portion (a.k.a. "provisioning") done, then it's as simple as leaving the computer powered on, powering down the new modem and your wireless, unplugging the ethernet from the computer and plugging it into the router, powering up the modem, and then powering up the wireless. What could be deceiving is the fact that the lowest light on the modem displays in red; to me this signifies a problem as opposed to a green signal--a design improvement IMO for the future. However, all was well with connectivity. So I'll see how performance seems over time and I'll comment if there's anything else pertinent to say about this fine little machine. Cheers!.

It has the look and feel of a much more expensive cable.  I realize that in most applications a cable is a cable, it either works or it doesn't, so I can't say that there is any performance benefit of one brand over another.The feel of quality with this cable is very tangible, it looks like one of those expensive brand names that would charge $50 for the same thing.  Like all Mediabridge cables and adapters the fittings plug in snugly, giving a feeling of confidence that they won't wiggle loose or fall out.  To assist removing the RCA plugs from a component there is a dimpled ring to grab on to.  The mini end is shipped with a strong plastic protection sleeve and is "stepped" to make it compatible with Apple devices.  The cable itself is pliable, neither too stiff nor too soft.  The red/white channel identifiers are large and easy to see in low light situations (like the back of a stereo rack).Kudos to both Amazon and Mediabridge in delivery ...

Computers break and hard drives fail. If you're like me, you have your entire music collection, countless photos, and important documents on your home computer. It's important to back up your files in at least one, if not two, places.Cloud services are becoming more popular, with the Amazon Cloud, the iCloud, Box, Dropbox, Google Drive and others offering free and paid cloud storage. While  these services have their merits, it would take me a super long time to upload my entire music collection (over 90 gigabytes) to a cloud service, so a hard drive is a better solution.Enter the Western Digital Two terabyte My Passport portable hard drive, which offers a relatively fast and easy way to back up your important files.The My Passport is super small. It's USB-powered, which means you don't need an adaptor to run the hard drive. One negative for me is the proprietary cable needed to connect the drive to your computer. If you lose the cable, you can't just go to the local Radio Shack and buy a micro-USB/USB cable, but you would need to order another one from Western Digital.The My Passport comes with backup software preinstalled. Just connect the drive to your computer, click on the software, and installation is quick (less than two minutes) and easy. Once installed, the software lets you do a lot of things, such as password protect the drive and encrypt your files, set timers to shut the drive off (so it doesn't run continuously) after a predetermined amount of time, run diagnostics, and register the drive. The software also categorizes your files (music, video, photos, etc.) and allows you to determine which files you want to backup.If you don't want to use the backup software, you can remove the software and simply "drag and drop" the files you want to back up manually. While potentially more time consuming, manually backing up will give you total control over which files to backup, and you will "see" the same files on your backup drive. The software encrypts everything, so, even though it's backed up on the My Passport, you can't see it and must retrieve it with the software. This is great if you have a lot of confidential files to backup, but if you are backing up music (or photos) you can't see the encrypted files even though they are there. A workaround is just to drag and drop your music and photos and use the software for more sensitive files.The My Passport comes with limited instruction. Just plug the unit into your computer and install the software (if you want to encrypt). A more comprehensive User's Guide is installed on the disk.Backing up more than 90 GB of music, photos, and videos took a little over two hours, which is pretty fast. With continuous and automatic backup, new music, photos, or documents will automatically be saved on the backup drive if I continue to use the pre-installed software.I recommend the 2 TB My Passport portable hard drive. While not inexpensive, the Western Digital drive offers an easy way to back up computer files, photos, videos, and music,  which may be hard if not impossible to replace. While not infallible, (hard drives will usually fail at some point) the 2 TB size offers enough space to backup the contents of my entire computer, and then some. The drive is super small, and the software is easy to use. I like the fact that I can simply drag and drop my files as well..

There are several fixes, but the most common and reliable way is to go to your Computer Management (Windows) and click the unrecognized drive "online". You can then assign it a different Drive Letter which will then allow you to see it every time you plug it in. Without going into too much details, basically WD assigned the same signature to the drives that is why it is showing up as one drive at a time. As a result, I moved the rating up to 5 stars. Enjoy!///Original: 12Oct2012///I love how small it still is (compared to a regular 1TB). When I travel I try to maximize my contents without compromising the weight and space taken. I often have to travel in just a backpack for several days so having the drive is perfect for having my digital movies and tv because it does not require an adapter for power (just USB) and it does not take up so much room. Because of the amount of files I own, I ended up buying 3 of these (only needed 2, but didn't realize I previously bought one already).I do however have some issues with it. Unfortunately, laptops cannot recognize two of the same type of drive. So if you were to transfer files from one drive to the next, you much use a median to temporarily store your data first (ie. laptop itself or a non-WD 2TB Passport Drive).Other than that, I am quite satisfied. Data transfer with USB 3.0 is noticeably superior to USB 2.0. In comparison to cheaper drives with USB 3.0 (not to cause blame on other drives), this performed data transfer faster and more consistently. I have used mine for some time now and through my travels overseas and it is still going strong even with the climate changes (extreme hot in the desert and snowing winter).Bottom line, a must have item for large media files during any time of travels due to its capacity, portability, and size. Just don't expect to be able to plug two at one time to your laptop and see both of them..

They are about the same size, right around 4.5".  I think the Griffin looks a little better.  Both work smoothly and don't get hung up on the screen at all.My red one from this set actually looks more fuchsia to me.  The clip on these styluses is plastic, while the Griffin's is metal.  But, the plug in the back end of the Griffin that actually holds the clip in place was loose right away.  I had to superglue it to secure the clip, which wasn't a problem and the glue has held even though I use the clip all the time.In the end, I think these three for a much cheaper price are the way to go.

I am not an audiophile. Noise Cancelation is the most important attribute to me.The Carrying Case: All three are quite durable and stiff.1.) Bose- the smallest, a low profile, room for an Ipod, accessories too.2.) Sennheiser- Square shape, low profile, however not a lot of room for anything else in case.3.) Audio Technica- Nice big case if you want to carry extra stuff (Nintendo DS, ipod, etc).Build Quality:1.) Sennheiser- you can tell this is built VERY well. Strong plastics, good components, thick cord. Top notch. You feel like you are getting something really high quality.2.) Audio Technica- Nice solid construction, appears durable.3.) Bose- If this had a Sanyo logo on the side, I would not have flinched. How can something $300 be so incredibly cheaply made.Size:1.) Bose- as far as over the ears go, these are pretty small.2.) Audio-Technica- mid-sized.3.) Sennheiser- These are big. No question, but they store flat.Comfort:1.) Sennheiser- Very comfortable, will fit almost any size ears. Keep on for hours.2.) Bose- Also comfortable. I did not experience "highs" discomfort.3.) Audio-Technica- Perfectly satisfactory. Larger opening than previous AT model.  Gets warm and tight on head on long flights.Sound:1.) Sennheiser- I actually wore these at home too, simply to hear parts of songs I had never heard before. Astounding. My 10yr old music collection sounded totally NEW.2.) Audio-Technica- Well balanced, good sound.3.) Bose- Great sound, but very heavy on the bass. I listen to a lot of rap and pop, so it was mildly annoying. I ultimately had to turn my treble settings up on my ipod to balance the sound.Features:1.) Sennheiser- nice cord, push to talk button (temporarily mutes NC and sound which is great for interruptions on airplanes).2.) Bose/Audio Technica- just the basics. Bose simply an on/off switch.Price:1.) Audio Technica- $150 to $225 depending on how you shop.2.) Sennheiser- $200 to $2753.) Bose- Hard to find below $300+.Noise Cancelation:1.) Bose- No question here, far surpassed the other two. Best Noise Cancelation.2.) Audio-Technica- Good Noise Cancelation.3.) Sennheiser- Not sure what happened here. Incredible sound, satisfactory noise cancelation.Summary:I ultimately kept the Bose because I was only using these for flying and the Sennheiser's (as much as I loved them) let me down in the Noise Cancelation department. The Sennheiser's had by far the most superior sound, but the Bose Noise Cancelation was night and day. The Bose are made very poorly for a $300+ product, it was disappointing.Final assessment:Audio-Technica- best balance of value for moneySennheiser- Best sound and comfortBose- Best Noise Cancelation.

It's a feeling that strikes me every time.  Turn the music on, and you will hear rich, clear sound.  It's not been since the nineteen seventies that I've seriously listened to sound through headphones, so I cannot tell whether these headphones compare well to other good phones.  What I do notice is that I hear noises in recordings I've listened to for decades through my DCM time windows speakers that I have never heard before.  My impression is that the sound is a little more colored with these than with my speakers, but it's not an unpleasant difference.  In short, I think the sound will satisfy all but the most demanding audiophiles.A great feature is that the earphones work to limit noise reaching your ears even when they are turned off.  Turn them on, and the effect is better.  Listen to music, and even  irritating noises can disappear into the background.  Again, I have not compared these to other noise canceling head phones, but I would characterize them as being pretty effective.Bose has made some design decisions that have proven to be very inconvenient to me.  I use the headphones at my desk when I work on my computer.  This means that it would be much more convenient  if they were powered through the USB cable.  But they're not.  They use triple-A batteries. A lot of triple A batteries - even though they use just one at a time. When the battery begins to get low it will work for a second or two.  Then the earphones will make a loud Pfft! noise that can be heard across the room.  Then silence.  Then, after a couple seconds the system works again for a second or two. And the Pfft!. And so on.  It's so irritating that being forced to listen to this for some time could be characterized as torture under the Geneva Convention. Ironic behavior for a device whose very purpose is to isolate us from sources of sonic discomfort; don't you think?There's another serious problem with the battery.  It's small.  And these headphones never sleep. Forget to turn off the headphones overnight, and you need to put in a new battery.  Listen for a few hours, and you need to put in another battery.  It seems that every time I pick up my headphones I need to put in another battery.  If you buy these headphones you must do one of three things:  either buy the giant boxes of triple A batteries offered at Costco or other wholesale markets, or buy a handful of rechargeable batteries and a recharger.  Or buy lots of shares in a battery manufacturing company of your choice, and write a favorable review of these headphones here.  Whichever you choose, consider it just a cost of using these headphones.  Otherwise you are likely to find yourself constantly out of triple-A batteries, and none of the reasons for spending this much on  good headphones will matter..

I got them to make long airplane flights more bearable, and they do that very well! They make the bad sounds go away, far away. They are big enough to cover your ears, but smaller and lighter than I had imagined they would be.  Comfortable enough and light enough to wear for very extended periods.  The noise cancellation works very well and produced no irritating effects that I was aware of.  I read in some other reviews that the sound reproduction is not &#34;audiophile&#34; quality.  That may be.. I have some nice Shure earbuds that are much brighter than these.. but these have a most pleasing quality to them, a fullness and a robust bass and maybe a little off the top end, that makes them so easy to listen to for long periods of time.  I used them on two flights of 12 hours each.  They didn't hurt my ears, they didn't become tiresome to listen to, and they didn't wear down, in fact all 24 hours were on ONE battery!  The compact hard-shell travel case is very nice to have, and has room to hold spare batteries and an adapter or two.  The only improvement I can imagine would be some kind of sensor to detect when they are not in use and turn off the power.  You have to remember to manually switch it off when you put them away, or you will run down the battery.  However, that's a minor complaint; they do have a little LED that indicates power on, it's facing you when you put them away, and you just have to remember to flip the switch and power down before you close the case.  I'm very happy with my purchase, and would highly recommend them to others..

First of all, I travel frequently (two or three times a month, at least), and noise cancelling headphones are ESSENTIAL for air travel. People don't seem to be as thoughtful as they used to be -- there's often someone blabbering loudly and incessantly on flights, as if they're oblivious to everyone else onboard. Or the person sitting next to me that thinks it's socially acceptable to spend an hour telling me their life story. Now...I'm no grouch, but there are limits.  Secondly, these Bose headphones have proven invaluable in my work, which often involves a lot of intense data analysis (I'm a computer security consultant).  With these headphones, I can disappear into a world of pleasant sound (I highly recommend Liquid Mind for studying or intense work!), and work far more efficiently and with a lot less stress.So...bravo! for the headphones, and a knockdown to four stars for the somewhat flimsy feel to them and the price. For $300 I'd expect something far sturdier, and the thin cord worries me a little.  No doubt Bose is making money hand over fist with these things, but hopefully it's not at the expense of quality.

I wanted to be able to sit with him while he watched television and I could read quietly.  I don't listen to much music so bought it primarily for the noise cancelling feature.  When I read all the great reviews about how these headphones could block out the roaring of a jet engine, figured this was the ticket.My husband put them on and even with his slightly impaired hearing, he could hear the sounds in the house and the television.  It doesn't block out any sounds for me either.I wrote to Bose five or six times and they didn't have any suggestions.  As for the music, I have three pairs of $6.78 EarPollution Plugz - and I don't think the Bose is any better than they are.If anyone has any suggestions as to what may be wrong with this pair we bought, I'd appreciate hearing from you.  I feel like we wasted $300 on something that doesn't have any more value than a throw-away pair.I wish I had something positive to write.  Most of my reviews are 5 stars but I'm going with a 1 on this one.  For those entertaining buying a pair, I'd suggest going to a store to try them before parting with your money.Update on May 27, 2012:Hi, Denia - and thanks for the two other suggestions that replied to my post.I've been emailing back & forth with Bose direct - and one tech support person asked me to try all kinds of things - up to and including running the dishwasher and standing in front of the washing machine. My husband & I both did that - and we had our help who is 1/2 our age do the same - and all three of us could hear the sounds. I thought they would help us and then I received this email from a different person - with a different twist:"Sorry for any confusion. The Quiet Comfort headset is designed specifically for frequent flyers. The technology is desgined to cancel out the constant low frequency tones of an airline engine. It does NOT cancel out every day ambient sounds such as children playing, dogs barking, tv audio, human voices (conversations in the back ground), or anything like that. In fact, I have a pair on right now, and I can hear the two people taking in the cubicle right next to me, very clearly. This is normall (sic).  Now, other customers use the headset for great audio reproduction while listening to their music, but the noise cancellation is designed to cancel out constant low frequency noises. The dishwasher and washing machine sounds are too intermittent to work, that would not tell you anything.Sorry if you thought the headset would work for your individual situation. It won't block out tv audio at all. If you bought the headset directly from Bose, less than 30 days ago, you can return them by calling 800-444-2673.

Big waste of money. Thought if it could block out the sound of a jet engine it would certainly be capable of blocking out the noise of a television set.I'll write to Bose again when "Barry" the tech was working and see if he can help me after the 3-day holiday is over.Perhaps putting disclaimer on this item - no where did I read that it was designed exclusively for noise cancelling - only for jets. I'll read the literature again; maybe I missed that section.I'd rate these a 1 if this is the case. $300 is a lot of money to spend on something that says "noise cancelling" - but only includes jet engine noise. If that's the case then that should be specifically stated. I'll write to the president of Bose and see if I can get some help from the top. Don't know unless you ask.As for any others looking for "noise cancelling" headsets, I strongly suggest going to a store and trying them before purchasing..

They're so light and comfortable.Fidelity - I believe I have a pretty discerning ear and can testify these phones are more than worthy for any music.  They're not heavy in any particular range and provide an accurate and balanced frequency response.  I use them on my iPhone, iPad and home entertainment equipment, no complaints.  If you're partial to boosting a particular frequency range, just dial up your equalizer.Noise Cancelation - Let's face it folks, Bose wrote the book on active noise cancelation.  They simply work far better than anything out there that I've tested.  Couple this technology with the passive isolation of the oh so comfortable, headphone pads and head set design and it's just you and your programing.The iPhone microphone and function switches work as advertised.  I only wish these headphones were wireless, but I guess you just can't have everything.

That being said, I had to replace the ear cushions (OEMs are roughly thirty bucks). I dont consider this a bad thing or a fault on Bose since the oils from your skin and sweat provide an acidic environment that will degrade these over time and i would much prefer the comfort of these over some other option that does not seal as nicely around your ears.If you want yours to last keep them in the case when not in use, roll the cord, and keep them off the floor.... Dogs love stepping on these, my 53 pound vizsla ran over them at full speed when my wife came home from work once and the momentum shot them a few feet in the air, slamming them into a wall. They didnt break, but very well could of.The noise canceling will save your ears since you no longer have to listen to music, movies, or tv shows at more than 1/3 to half volume to drown out the environment.

But now when they're walking around a lot, running their dishwasher, or running their washing machine, I can totally block them out when I am trying to watch my TV shows. I should have gotten these headphones a long time ago. And I just had to replace the battery, but that was a great experience too. The power light was blinking for a day or two, and I just kept using them. And when the battery finally died, the sound cut in and out, and then there was no more sound, so I knew that I had used up all of the battery power, and it was a good feeling knowing I pushed the battery as far as it could go.

By noise cancelling, they don&#8217;t just mean passive means of thick padded cups muffling the outside noise &#8211; they mean there are small microphones on the outside and inside of the headset, and using a small battery in the headphones, they actually create a negative sound wave to cancel out the outside sounds.  Result:  does I would call a 100% and sort of &#8220;magic trick&#8221; job at completely cancelling out low end sounds: fan noise, dryer noise, noise of air through heating ducts, traffic going by the house, doors opening and closing.  Does a 80-90% job to cancel out voices: basically you can hear voices still a lot, but because all of the low end is removed from the voice, you hear only a very low volume tinny remnant of the voices around you.  So if your MAIN purpose of buying them is to cut out voices very near around you within just a few feet, know that it does NOT remove 100% of very nearby talkers.All that is just putting on the headset, without even using the cord.  The cord actually can be removed from the phone so you don&#8217;t have to have a dangling wire when you are only using it for noise cancelling.  Flip the switch from OFF to ON, while wearing the headset, and you can hear it go from passive noise cancelling (just due to the pads and cups of the headphone), to active circuitry negating the outside sounds.I remember the first time I donned these, was on a American Airlines flight.  I was sitting in first class, and American Airlines planes are very old, so they don&#8217;t have a separate TV screen for every chair (like a lot of other airlines do &#8211; many like Jet Blue every seat on the plane has its own personal TV that you can watch any movie or whatever separately from your neighbor).  Anyway, since American doesn&#8217;t have individual movie screens, they gave everyone in first class an iPad, and a pair of these Bose headphones.I put them on, and holy crap!  ALL of the plane engine noise disappeared - so much so, that I couldn&#8217;t believe what I was hearing (wasn&#8217;t hearing really).  I didn&#8217;t realize it was using active noise cancelling, I just figured these were the best set of foam padding headphones in the world by design!  I remembered them a month ago around Christmas time when my house was full of my family being home, and after a few days of not getting anything work done while working at home (luckily I don't take phone calls, but work at my computer all day long), I ordered them.It comes with two included snap-in cords: one regular (left/right audio, 3 pin 1/8 inch mini), and one made for iPhones, iPads, and other devices, and another cord - 1/8 inch mini with 4 contacts on the barrel,  that you can use with your iPhone or whatever as a headset with a microphone.  Yes, it will use the microphone that is built into the headset for noise cancelling as a standard audio microphone if you use the second cord.  There's also an inline controller on the cord so you can do volume UP, volume DOWN, and MUTE.  When you start to listen to anything, it drowns out the outside sound even more &#8211; just by diverting your attention I suspect, and the fact that you can play the music so LOW in volume to work, while outside sounds are removed, plain and simply said &#8211; it is a really cool experience for doing quiet concentrative work.I&#8217;ve been wearing them while working every day at home, even now that the wife and daughter are back to work and school, and I am the only one home, I still prefer to wear them to be productive!Sure, maybe if ALL you want is 100% noise cancelling, being around construction, or whatever, maybe a $1.99 set of foam ear plugs, that you roll in your finger to make them small, and let them expand in your ear and block out nearly all the sound, MIGHT be better (I want to do that test to compare as I am interested to see).  But I am totally happy with them, and will never FLY again without bringing them so I can have a super quiet flying experience on any airline, and will now just see how long it takes to burn out the single AA battery with enjoyment all the way!.

You have to be careful with it--don't expect to leave it lying around or hooked around your neck or shoulder for periods of time when not in use. It probably needs to be kept in its case.I used my QC15 recently on a long flight from the States to Southeast Asia, aboard a Singapore Airlines Airbus A380. I had some issues using my QC15 with the in-flight entertainment system. There was a constant buzzing sound that made it impossible to use on movies. I had my backup Audio Technica ANC23 Noise-Cancelling earbuds, and did not have this problem (I had to fiddle with the in-line volume control by bumping up the volume on the ANC23 and turning down the master volume on the in-flight system. The ANC23 does not have nearly as good noise cancellation as the QC15, but in this particular instance, it won out. Too bad the in-linw controls for the QC15 is only for iPod use. I switched out the battery and used a different airline adapter--same problem. However, when I used the QC15 with my iPod, no issues whatsover--the sound was pristine clear minus all ambient noise. Unbelievable.Had the same issues on the return flight, so I am not sure whether it is the plane, the entertainemtn system, an incompatibility with the QC15, or a combination of the three. Just be aware there may be some issues with using the QC15 on some in-flight systems, and it is not a deficiency in the headphones per se, since it works perfectly well in all other respects.Your best bet for the best combination of noise cancellation and quality sound..

I compared them to the similar priced Sennheiser and Beats headphones. By far these are the better headphones. The in-store demo units at Best Buy really demonstrate the audio quality and noise canceling. The headphones are light on your head, the aduio quality is amazing, the noise canceling is the best I've ever experienced (or not experienced), and the built in ipod remote in the cable is great. You will hear additional details in the music you never heard before. You can really pick out the instruments and vocals. The sound has depth and unlike most headphones they make me feel like I am in a front row of a concert just for me. Some/most headphones just blast the music out at your where you don't get that depth where if it feels like the sound is coming feet away rather than an inch or two to your ear. These headphones are great, but if you like rap or music with insane amount of bass you may want to get Beats. The bass is great on the Bose, but if all your music is Boom Boom Pow and Rap then you may want to opt for that tiny 8% better bass for that kind of music. I'm not saying the bass is bad on these. I listen to Boom Boom Pow, but I also love country, top 40, rock, rap, r&b;, alternative, audio books, j-pop, and more. Try listening to a song like "Everywhere" by Fleetwood Mac and not smile at the quality and depth. I like a little bit of rap and these are fine. Boom Boom Pow sounded amazing. I know, I've actually seen Black Eyed Peas in concert and the song sounded exactly like the concert except for the screaming since it was not the live version of the song. The control on the cable is very handle for anyone with an ipod (1st and 2nd gen may not work with the ipod controls on some versions of the ipods). I can adjust the volume, skip songs, fast forward, rewind, play, and pause with controls. I never have to turn on my ipod touch screen (I always play random). That is a huge selling point since I listen to music every night to relax to that very point you will fall asleep within a minute. The case is very sturdy and feels sturdy enough to protect the bose headphones against nearly anything except sitting on it. The leather on the headphones is soft and genuine and it feels amazing on your head. The ear cups are so soft and comfortable you almost forget your wearing headphones. The noise cancelling at home drowns out my sister if she is more than 10 feet away and my 2 bedroom fans are completely quiet. My room is right next to the attic fan and it virtually drowns it out to next to nothing. The headphones are very stylish with the black on chrome look.Now, the cons. Price. I've known for a while that Bose is the king of headphones imo. These are actually the first Bose headphones I've ever bought. I've kind of had this as my headphone history. Ipod headphones (no bass) -> $6 walmart special ear buds -> $15 aiwa over hear headphones -> sennheiser cx300 (first quality ear buds) -> able planet 1000 series noise cancelling (300 new 55 on ebay since no one knows about them) -> bose qc 15s. I was happy with the able planets since I tested them out at the airport and they blew my sennheiser cx300's out of the water and they were the first noise cancelling headphones I've ever had. I still love them. However, my Dad did something to me. We were early to the theater and went to Best Buy to kill 30 minutes. I saw the Bose booth and tried them out. I just wanted to know how they compared. I tried them out and it was the next level. Sound wise it was only like 9-12% better. Barely a big improvement. Where it was better was the comfort, the audio depth (feeling like your in a concert), and the near complete silence. I heard nothing in Best Buy with the Bose. I hear nothing in my room. My able planets I could hear 20% of the fan noise, but it was less than a whisper. I'm a gadget nut so I had to have them. $300 is a crazy amount of money. So I went to ebay for them. After three days of trying I finally found a like new pair of Bose QC 15s for $195 on ebay. Just a couple of surface scratches and it was the first batch they released in 2010 that did not come with the ipod cable. Oh well on the cable, my ipod touch has volume controls and my able planets did not have it. I ended up finding a $6 ilove adapter that adds the ipod remote to any headphone and I thought I was good. The headphones came in and they were flawed. The sound quality was really good. However, whenever music was not playing I had a hum on the left headphone. I re-seated the cables, swaped batteries, and even borrowed my Dad's ipod and it did not fix it. Now, you think it is not a huge problem. Just listen to music. However, some music have tiny little parts of silence and that will get annoying quick. What I ended up having to do was call Bose and they helped me. It looks like the first batch of Bose headphones do not have a serial number, so unless you kept your box you will have to pay for the repair. They don't actually repair. The offer a $100 trade in option where you can get a new set or the new set of the newest model. Long story short. DON'T BUY USED! I know they are probably pretty rugged, but I am treating these like babies and I will not bring them with me on the plane. Not only because I am worried about them and possibly paying $100 again, but because of space. I am getting into digital photography with slr cameras. I have this case logic bag I am bringing with me so I can listen to music, use my ipad, slr equipment, and a person item or two. In order for it to fit in this bag, I have to have headphones that fit in a space about the size of a can of pop (len's compartment). They had a sale on Amazon a few weeks ago on the 2011 model white Able Planet noise cancelling headphones that fold up and they were $40. I will be using those for vacations. The able planets are amazing. However, I am a bit of a audiophile and I want the Bose at home.I highly recommend these headphones if you have the $300. The noise cancelling, audio quality, and comfort are incredible. By far the depth (concert like sound) and noise cancelling sold me. You will be very happy with these. Anyone who really loves music and travels frequently should buy these. Now, if you are find with giving up 20-25% of the noise cancelling, some depth, and audio quality that is basically within 1/4" of $300 headphones I would look at the able planets. When I was traveling last March they had those headphones at the airport stores to try. Save yourself some money. Look online and get those able planets used or on sale. My first pair had a msrp of $300 and I got it for $55 on ebay. No one single counter bid since they are not as famous as Bose. If you need foldable get the new white pair for $40-$50 and it sounds 95% as good as my higher quality Able Planet. I'd highly recommend the foldable one for teenagers or anyone who does not travel often and wants a great quality noise canceling headphone on the plane. Just know that besides for the sennheiser cx300's, I have not used the Able Planets or Bose on the plane. I can't comment on that. I know the Bose works great on the plane. If my 80's attic fan is virtually drowned out to a whisper with my able planets than the plane noise should be nearly drowned out to a whisper..

I now count them among my "necessities" for air travel.  I don't have any way to compare them with other noise-cancelling phones, nor have I had these for more than a month, but let me say that I watched several movies on a 12 hour flight and never removed them. The audio on the movies came through crystal clear.  Between movies I napped in relative "silence".  I saw two other "commuters" on a long flight wearing the same phones without a wire.  You don't need external audio input to enjoy the benefit of noise-cancelling.It is only when you remove them that you realize just how terribly noisy it is on an airplane. I don't know if there is a connection, but since I have used the headphones I have not experienced my usual headaches. In any event, noise- cancelling headphones are miraculous, and Bose has to be among the best.  It is ALMOST like sitting in a quiet room, very peaceful, and well worth the investment..

They are still going strong.  Here are some pro's and con's:THE GOOD- The sound spoils me. Really. It is hard to tolerate listening to music with any other lesser speakers (not just headphones).  Indeed, with these, One hears nuances in my music that I did not notice before. The way I would describe the music is CRISP, deap and spacious.- Noise canceling is excellent. I am disabled after suffering brain trauma and  cannot tolerate much noise nor commotion around my home - yet I have three small kids!  These Bose save the day; all-day and everyday. I can block out most of the noise with the noise canceling just turned on without music. When the rest of the noise needs to disappear, I simply play some light music from my iPad. The world magically becomes completly silent. love them!- They are extremely light and comfortable. I can wear them for hours a day with very little fatigue. These are the only over the ear headphones which I have owned that do not rub my ears and cause irritation.- I love that e cord easily detaches from the headphones so that I can take advantage of the noise canceling without chords.THE BAD- They do create a practically airtight seal which causes a weird air preassure change that you feel. Wearing them with the noise canceling turned on thus has an effect on your ears as though you were swimming a few fear under water. I have gotten use to it but it took me a few days. Everyone whom I have had tried he headphones, notices this air preassure change. Yet, they tolerate it because they are blown away by the noise canceling and the quality of sound.- The only other con is that they do cause my ears to heat up and slightly sweat. I find that I need to take the headphones off every 30 minutes or so, just to give my ears a breather for a few seconds.In short, these bose QC 15's come highly recommended. If your purchase them, I can pretty much gaurentee that you will enjoy them and feel that they are well worth the money..

In the bose that I got as used I used to hear my old song collection in a new different way and lot of low frequency music was easily and noticably reproduced in Bose. Quite disappointed with Synnheiser I was packing it for returns. I ordered this Bose QC Comfort 15 so that it arrives before I could return Synn. Had few hours of parallel testing and Bose was a clear winner. Although Bose loses on the fact that its not a bluetooth enabled headphone, but for the difference between the prices I can easily get a Bose + bluetooth headset and still cost lesser than synnheiser.

The only con is that you feel like if you were at the bottom of a pool, weird at the beginning but you will enjoy your music and get used to. Actually the best in the market. Another bad thing is that it will be so quiet and crystal clear that if you have bad quality songs you will know it and hate those songs, you will skip them!Sound is superb, crystal clear and balanced(Maybe not too much bass, if you want bass go with Beats or Rock equalizer). There are some others headphones that sound a bit better but you won't even notice(this doesn't mean these sound bad, actually the sound is pretty good, REALLY good).Construction is plastic is GREAT, i don't have nothing to complain on those headphones about construction they feel really good and strong, just a bit large, but still looks cool. The headphones are big, not for tiny heads like childs even in the smaller size(it will fall off or move). The cable is strong but is a bite long, a bit longer than the normal lenght so you will have to get rid of the lenght. By the way, REALLY COMFORTABLE.Love the AAA battery can replace it really easy, you can buy it everywhere and it's cheap or use an rechargeable one; the QC3 uses an lithium special battery (expensive and you will need to buy an extra one or replace it someday, and if you go out of charge you are done, no more music.)The case is pretty fine, hard but a bit big. I don't even use it, i'm always wearing those headphones. It has a little bag for batteries it has a velcro behind so you can take it down or turn it.You get an extra cable (with remote for apple products), airplane adapter, and a bunch of courtesy cards if someone ask you about these headphones.I don't have complains about the headphones i love them! I've had Senheisser, Bose, Sony, a BUNCH of headphones, normal ones (and in-ear) and cancelling ones.Maybe a bit expensive but worth it. By the way, Amazon customer service was great, i didn't receive the headphones at first, they were really helpful and fast! 1 minute after i opened the claim and was resolved, the send me a new ones!

However, I have B&W; speakers in my home.  I don't need the Bose there.  Where I do need them is on the road.  This is where the Bose shines.  The noise canceling feature works as described and is absolutely wonderful.  I use them in the office, on the plane, on the train, and everywhere else in between.  Often, I'm using them without any music at all, because I just want to shut the world out so I can concentrate and do work or sleep or whatever it is I need to do.You'll find among frequent travelers, this is the headphone of choice.  There's a reason, and it's simply that nothing comes close to the noise canceling these headphones provide.As far as playing music through them?  Well, they're Bose.  They're good quality Bose, but they're still Bose.  Still, they're better than most products out there, including the ultra-trendy Dre Beats, and will beat any in-ear headphone you want to name.  They could be better, but I can't complain.  I didn't pay $300 for them for the audiophile sound quality.

I determined that for my taste (it is critical that you determine this prior to entering your &#34;shopping&#34; mode as it each offer drastically difference experiences depending on how you like to listen to your music) that the Bose QC15 headphones were it for me. I appreciated the bass that the Beats had, but I'm not a head bopper, not really a fan of rap since I like music with real lyrics and you know, people with real talents so I determined these might not be the fit. I also did not like that they felt like they could break easily.....as a matter of fact, of the various stores I went to look at them (Best Buy, Apple Store, Target) many of the models were actually broken.....surely that can be both attributed to faulty manufacturing as much as moronic teenagers playing around with expensive toys. I didn't like anything about the Sennheiser so I won't elaborate further on that model. By the time I got to the Bose store I was basically pleading in my head for these to be it and I'm so glad I saved these for last because it made me appreciate everything the other two were not to me. I liked the design much better, sleek but classy, the bass and treble are much more balanced providing a nicer listening experience. I tried it with every genre I could find in my library, hip/hop, jazz, folk, alternative, dance music, and the lyrics were much clearer to me. Also, I want to point out, I travel for a living so the &#34;sound canceling&#34; part of these headphones was critical. I'm pleased to say that when they're on the world really is tuned completely out to you which is amazing when you have a screaming kid (or 10) on your plane.Comfort was important to me as well and I like that I can wear them on 11 hour flights without hesitation, without having my ears feel irritated by the material, etc.I do have to note, this is my second pair (thank God for my square trade warranty) because one of the cuffs broke off after much wear and tear which happened after 3 years of wearing on my big noggin' (no surprise it happened really) but with my 2nd pair came two options of cables to plug in to the devices you'll be using. The traditional option and an option which comes with a volume control and speaker for Apple products so that was a nice bonus.In all, I have about a million positive things to say about them but I don't want to bore you all with them, just know, it's the best $300 I spent!.

I used them most every day. I don't listen to music loudly and the headphones just sit on my desk when not in use. I think I take relatively good care of my things.Today, the left ear started making a hissing noise. If I wiggle the cable connector (the plug that inserts into the headphones' jack - not the computer/device end) the left ear starts to work for a few seconds and then goes back to making the hissing noise. The hissing noise is the same exact noise you hear when wearing them but noise cancelling is turned off (no sound from device and a muffled background noise). If I unplug the cable all together and turn noise cancelling on, only the right ear works. The left ear sounds like noise cancelling is turned off. This bit of self testing suggests the jack inside the headphones has a loose connector or the left speaker is blown/on its way out. This isn't something a new cable will resolve (which are relatively cheap and I wouldn't mind shelling out for). Bose apparently only warranties their products for a year now, so I am SOL.EDIT: After more playing with it, I have determined the issue is in fact a blown speaker. See below for a potential fix you can perform for less than a penny, but know it is only a temporary fix. You will need to re-position the fix quite often.For 300 dollars, these headphones really should have lasted a lot longer than they did. I'm rather upset. I had always been told Bose produced quality products that would last generations / not just months. That's why I ultimately chose these over the competitors.While they worked, I loved them. The sound was great, and working as a software engineer with loud fans all around me, the noise cancelling was heaven-sent. I talked them up to everyone, including my CEO. I guess I have to backpedal on all that now.EDIT: I found a fix on YouTube for the issue I had. I am not upgrading my rating as they shouldn't break in the first place, and this isn't a true fix, but more of a patch - it doesn't last forever and requires re-positioning on occasion.

The Beats really looked and felt flimsy.  I really wasn't that impressed with the build quality at all.  They just seemed poorly made and comparing the two I felt like the Beats would not hold up very well in the long run.  The Bose QC 15's felt way better IMO.  I tried both on and maybe I have small ears, but they both covered them pretty well.  Sound wise I was only able to listen to the Bose because the Beats had a broken cable so the music didn't come through the headphones at all. The Bose sounded really good and while I didn't get to hear the Beats, just by the way they felt and how flimsy they looked, I chose the Bose.  They came in yesterday and I was amazed at how well they blocked out ambient noise.  I had a basketball game on close by and they just blocked about 95% of the sound right out without any music playing.  Once I played some music they I could hardly hear anything else at all.

I've had the QC15 for about a month now - using them sparingly and awaiting my overseas trip in a few weeks.

Any given commercial flight today will have at least one person wearing a set of these more than likely and there's a great reason for that.  They just flat out work.  There's a lot of stuff I don't want to hear while flying: engine noise, wind noise, flight attendants, pilots, screaming babies, the annoying lady sitting next to me, etc.  Put these on, voila.  Problem solved, all those annoying noises go away or are at least greatly attenuated.  I've heard better sounding headphones but the QC15s are super comfortable for me, provide excellent noise cancellation and make flying a much more pleasant experience IMHO.  Along with a good carrying case and the ability for the first year at least to replace at any Bose store, they're one of my essential travel tools.

As for the headphones themselves, they do an incredible job at noise cancellation and are wonderful when used for listening to music. A lot of people have mentioned that they don't provide enough base, but to me they seem just fine. The noise cancellation is the main reason why I purchased them, as I like to sit outside on a balcony that's somewhat close to the road. They almost completely eliminate the noise of cars going by. The only comment that I can make regarding these that may be a concern, is that I suspect Bose will be introducing a newer version within the next 18 months. The latest version was introduced in 2009, with minor upgrades for use with Apple products in 2011. I called Bose to ask if they would be coming out with a newer model anytime soon, and as expected they declined to answer my question. Based on this model(with the exception of the 2011 upgrades) being 3-4 years old, I'm guessing that a newer one will be offered soon.

I can reduce external noise and concentrate on whatever I am doing. All that staticky background noise disappears but I can *usually* still hear when people are speaking directly to me.

The batteries last quite a long time and usually start making a clicking noise before they go entirely dead, so don't assume they are broken if you start hearing that. I can hear movies and music very well on noisy airplanes while using them, but often just flick them on and leave them unplugged to take advantage of the sound barrier it appears to create. Have I effectively turned them into really expensive earplugs? Yes... maybe I have. But only 50% of the time.I use these:- on the plane& in noisy airports- at work around loud machines- when surrounded by small children- anywhere I am trying to read- when the neighbors at my hotel were throwing a 4th of July partyI love them.

My only complaints are size and occasional performance issues.Size:These things are quite big.  In the day in age of being nickled and dimed during any travel experience for bag fees and neary fist fighting for overhead bin space, size matters.  The included soft sided case is quite nice but again size is an issue.  I find them difficult to fit into my bag at times but their benefits far out weight the minor annoyance of finding a place to cram them into.Performance Issues:Occasionally a fellow traveler seems to have a natural voice frequency that simpler cannot be &#34;noise-canceled&#34; by these things.

Quite different from the audiophile sound Bose hypes, they are heavily tweaked, mid-range-weak, unnatural sound, perhaps good for heavily amped rock music but pretty poor for classical, or indeed any unzapped acoustic, music.Another annoyance is that the headphones have no passive mode. They ONLY work with the noise cancellation switched on.I feel like I've paid for Bose's marketing, not for good headphones.(Note: I bought these from Amazon but do not show up as a confirmed buyer because I'd bought the "special edition" ones, identical except for the color)..

Set some presets with lower contrast because these screens are bright! On a long night of trolling the internet you'll probably want to turn them down a little eventually...or at least put on your cool guy aviators.I'm coming from using a single 42'' LCD TV as my computer monitor for the past 3 years.I ordered two of these bad boys withthis deskandthis dual monitor mount.My setup is great (perfect, actually) but one of the monitors is a bit warmer than the other and I'm having a hard time adjusting it..that is that one monitor has an orangeish tint and the other is more bluish. I've been shooping pictures in Gimp for years so I'm no stranger to changing RGB levels individually but matching two of these monitors has been difficult.At first I used the included (extremely short!) single link DVI cables but switched to HDMI since it advertises a max 75hz refresh rate over the 60hz on single DVI. Even if it's a placebo, the difference is night and day and no one will tell me otherwise. And no one will tell you that, either. (if they do, ask who let them in your house.)Also with switching to HDMI, AMD Catalyst software won't let me adjust the temperature anymore :( and my video cards each only have one HDMI port so I lose crossfire. It's a win/lose/lose and for now I might actually go back to the shoddy Asus DVI cables.No dead pixels. Beautiful, bright color and dark contrasts. LED is just stunning! You'll be able to see each of Mr. Muffins' whiskers once you flip on that 1080p on YouTube.3- year warranty. Woo. No dead pixels now and Asus says they'll fix yo schtuff for free if one dies in the next few years.I've tested Fallout NV, L4D2, and WoW on Eyefinity with two of these beastly monitors and it is beautiful. (I run two Crossfired 2GB@900Mhz ATI 695x graphics cards.)I knocked a star off for the slight nagging color mismatch, and very short DVI cables. The color mismatch is very noticeable and really annoying which is weird because I'm usually not so attentive to those sorts of details.Going to pick up some dual link DVI cables eventually and see if I can't get that temperature adjustment back because it was the closest I could get these monitors to identical without spending more money on some external calibration device..When I'm not able to adjust the color temp directly the mismatch is very pronounced and extremely hard to tune.I think I'm going to eventually get a third monitor but I abhor the idea of having to tune three different temperatures when it's near impossible to align two.Update: After Messing around with multiple settings, I'm convinced one of my monitors is bad. It just has to be...during nearly every calibration I have tried one of the monitors has a blue tint to it and I absolutely cannot get the "X" to become invisible during the brightness adjustment..Knocking another 1.5 stars off.

Here are my first impressions. I purchased this monitor for watching movies and programming. I have no interest in games so factor this into my review.1. Packaging: Box is solid and surprisingly compact. The included Styrofoam packing is fragile so be careful when unpacking as the thin areas will break of in your hand. You may want to keep the packaging intact in case you need to return yours. Monitor and base are plastic wrapped for scratch resistance. You may want to keep this also. The accessories are all plastic wrapped.2. Enclosed instructions and manual: I found the multilingual Quick Start Guide to be very hard to read... Look at it and you will understand. The font is extremely small. The enclosed ASUS VIP Member Notice is printed in a very small font but is readable. Note that the ASUS warranty is described therein. The coverage is 3 years parts/labor and two-way shipping in US and Canada. Note that bad pixel covers at least 3 white pixels or at least 5 dark pixels. I searched for ASUS VS248 and downloaded the user manual and it is much better. I also downloaded and installed an application that runs in the background. It is called ASUS Multiframe that allows you to divide you desktop.3. Accessories: Power cable, DVI cable and VGA cable. Others have complained that it should come with an HDMI cable. I have no issue with this.4. Physical/Structural impressions: Weighs less than half the Dell 2410 that it replaced. It also emits almost no heat compared to the Dell. The stand installs with little thought and effort. The stand is a bit "wobbly" but the monitor is VESA compliant so a stand can be purchased for $20-$40, if that is an issue. The monitor sits low on the desktop and I am leaning toward purchasing a stand.5. Performance/Quality: No bad pixels. Plenty of preset modes for me. I will adjust it later. Text looks fine with varying quality depending on the application without any "painful" text reading experiences. No LED bleed through around the edges. I am happy with the presets but may fiddle with other settings.6. Miscellaneous: The headphone jack works if you use an HDMI cable. There is a bit of hum and noise (hissing) that is slightly noticeable when no audio is playing. I found it to be a minor issue since I do not notice it while playing movies or music. Some may find it annoying if there are moments of silence while viewing movies or listening to music.7. Update: Today I discovered that the screen extends off the left edge of the desktop about 3/16". I pressed the S/A button for 2 to 4 seconds per the user's manual. The problem was not corrected. I reduced my rating to 3 stars.8. Second Update: Last night, while watching Netflix with the lights off, I noticed LED bleed through on the left and right hand sides of the monitor. This is only noticeable in a dark room. I also noticed that objects on the Win 7 desktop with diagonal elements are aliased significantly, that is they have jagged edges. I also noticed aliasing on the on the corners of the application windows. There is also aliasing for some fonts while viewing web pages. I have reduced my rating to 2 stars.Note that my 3 year old Dell u2410 did not display any of the anomalies as this monitor. I am considering returning it.9. Third Update: The "control" buttons are on the underside of the lower right hand corner of the monitor. Because the monitor sits so very low, there is little room for your hand to move over the different buttons while adjusting the settings. This is a significant issue for me. I am not happy. Down to 1 star.10. Fourth Update: When I start to use an application ( Media Center or Media Player ) to watch a DVD, the monitor blacks out and then the screen returns displaying which video interface is being used - HDMI. My previous HD monitor did not behave in this manner.11. Fifth Update: I decided to return this item. I purchase an ASUS PA248Q. It has a built in 4 port USB 3.0 hub, Display Port, HDMI, DVI, VGA ports and a stand that is highly adjustable allowing the monitor to be rotated into portrait layout. The stand is very very sturdy. There are 120 additional lines of resolution, 1920 X 1200. For me, this justified the extra $100 or so dollars..

Finally sent it in (and they did pay for shipping at least, but they couldn't get me the label so I had to schelp the thing 30 blocks to a FedEx place to return it - and it's bulky to carry!).  Two and a half weeks later, my monitor is returned to me in the same box i sent it in.  It worked for 2 days and then the same problem occurred. And now, i've got all sorts of lines on the screen. Call Asus - talk to a rep who says he's going to send me a new monitor.  Week goes by and hear nothing. Call Asus. Rep says, &#34;oh it's shipped&#34; and gives me the tracking number.  But it's the tracking number for the package I've already received with my original defective monitor!. Call Asus again.

I decided to try the Roku 2 XS because i needed an extra media player for my living room, as i was using WD for my bedroom. I think the Roku XS is a great device for streaming media from channels (NBC, Netflix, CNET, etc). But don't think you are going to get every episode of everything for free. Content from free channels are limited. The Roku is NOT flawless, it does have some pluses and minuses. I think the user interface on the Roku is slightly better than the WD because it is a bit more fluid, doesn't have that extra one second lag when performing easy functions like typing and searching. It also has more channels than the WD. However, WD has YouTube and Roku doesn't, but then again Roku has Amazon Prime streaming, and WD doesn't. So each device has its own perks. These two devices would be perfect if i could smash them into one ultimate media player. What one has, the other lacks.Setup for the most part was fairly easy, but immediately after setting up wi-fi, Roku must do a software update and for some reason, it wouldnt download it so i kept fiddling with this thing for over an hour. I plugged in my ethernet plug and then it FINALLY downloaded, only when wired. Yes, this does require the buyer to disclose their credit card information. It doesn't charge the customer, but they save it on file for future use when customers want to buy certain channels, etc. I was a bit annoyed because a lot of the channels included required a log in name and password. After awhile, it just got plain annoying. Even using the Roku requires one to sign up and create a Roku account. Also remember that with the Roku player, having a solid wi-fi connection is a must. If not, just get the high-end XS model and plug in the ethernet plug to avoid buffering issues. I really wanted something simple to plug and play. The Roku doesn't play movie files that are just ripped from a DVD. The movie must be formatted and will play in MP4 format (all my movie files are in MP4 format). Overall, i am pleased, but i think if i were to get another streaming media player i'd go with WD.Pros:Semi-easy setupNice user interfaceSome nice free channels (CNET TV, Anime, etc)Small and compact sizeAngry BirdsPlays MP4 movie filesPandora, Amazon Prime, HBOFast Fowarding on movie files is a breezePlays movies from USB memory sticksPlays movies from external 2TB hard drive (2TB max, can't do 3TB)Cons:Doesn't play AVI movies filesCan't play Windows Media Player movie filesOnly 1 USB slotMedia folders from external HD are not in A-Z orderMenu customization is a bit limitedAdvertisies 300 plus channels, but i don't see that manyDoesn't have YouTubeDoesn't have VEVODoesn't have progressive scan (when you go back to a movie you were in the middle of, it will start from the very beggining as oppose 2 where one left off)**Keep in mind a solid wi-fi connection is a must or one will encounter many buffering issues and streaming movies not playing at all. I don't know if this is a Roku thing, or if people have cheap wi-fi routers (i am pretty sure it is a Roku thing), but i encountered many issues and the only way to avoid this is by connecting an ethernet plug into the device. I encountered no issues when the device was wired.**.

I have a netflix, hulu plus, and amazon prime subscriptions so I definitely wanted to use those channels immediately. I haven't had any issues with it. I always have something to watch. I am not a game person, but I did download some games to play when I'm bored. The remote is a pretty cool tool. There are so many channels to pick from, but some of them you do need to have a paid subscription to and that's just fine.

So, first, I would like to thank all the people out there that wrote helpful reviews.Could this product be better?  Sure it can be ... and it probably will be as time goes on, but this review is written about what this product is, not what I wish it would do as many others will do.Set up is truly 5 min out of the box.  I had already set up my Roku account before the unit arrived.  I understand some are hesitant to give out a credit card for things they may never purchase, but I'm comfortable with it.  I understand there is a work around as mentioned in some of the other reviews on this model or others.The Roku account lets you add widgets of different content, much of which is free.  I was only concerned with Netflix at the time, but since then have added many different channels.I chose this model (currently their most expensive) for two features the others didn't have.  One is the CAT connection and the other was the USB playable port.  Truthfully, I have never felt the need to run that wire from my router to the the TV and so I have been using this on the WiFi since day one.The USB was going to be my solution on how to play movies, music or pictures that reside on my office PC in the other room. But, then I heard about Plex and I think the Free Version of Plex solved all my current PC to Media issues.  I did have an issue of on movie not playing over Plex, so I burned it to my USB 4gig and it played flawlessly.  I should note, that you do have to install a USB Media app, available for free from the Roku Store to use this function.  This app will handle the codecs it needs to run different types of media.  Other than JPEG and MP3, I usually rip to MKV or MP4.This version will play in 1080p, though my current set is only 720p, so I'm not sure of the quality differences here.  I have also purchased the HD model for my 32&#34; CRT in the other room and since the HD model is also 720p (max) it plays Netflix much clearer than my Wii does.  I think the Wii is playing at 480 res.I've read negative reviews about Amazon Prime not streaming well, but I only have Netflix and it works great.  Netflix starts out in low res but within seconds, becomes hi res as it buffers.  What I understand about A. Prime is that it picks a res for you according to bandwith and you're stuck with that even if your bandwidth gets stronger during play. If this is true, then it's more in the app than the hardware.The remote is a RF, not the IR model like the HD model.  This means that you can be out of Line of Sight of the unit and still operate it.  The advantage of this is if you want to attach the unit out of sight, like behind the TV or DVD Player, no problem.  The remote on this unit also doubles as a gaming remote and this player is loaded (after you update it) with Angry Birds.  I had never played this game before, and after several hours one night had to quit cold turkey.  Watching netflix is already a big Time Sink in my life, I didn't need to make it worse.  The control isn't as responsive as a PS3 anyway, but the game is still addictive enough.I was lucky enough to get this for a great price on Amazon, $10 less than Roku.com.  I purchased my HD model for my CRT tv at Walmart on a whim, when I saw they had for $48, two dollars less than Amazon and $12 less than their Roku's site.During the last 30 days both units have run cool to the touch, never gone &#34;offline&#34; (wireless) and I am 100% happy with the way this unit runs.  I'm running on Comcast with my own Motorola Modem and a Medialink Router and getting about 25 mbps through both RJ45 and Wireless ... so, how this unit will run on less than 11 mbps (my U-verse), I'm not sure.  What I am sure about is, I am cancelling my U-verse account this month as my contract is over and never looking back.In the box you get RCA cables (Right & Left Audio and Video) which works fine for low-res TVs, but you will need to spring for a HDMI cable if you don't have one.  The good news is, if you can mount this to the back of your set, it can me an ultra short cable.  The power adapter is small and like I said before, all runs cool, with no heat issues.I use Plex as much if not more than I use Netflix, so I would highly recommend checking that software out.  Hulu Plus is supported on my unit so I'm not sure if that was an update since the reviews I read or what.  I chose Crackle for older movies and also Foxnews for my current events.  There is even adult access via an app but I didn't find that on the Roku Store, I had to do a goodle search to get the code.So, after hardware and any subscription based services such as Hulu, Netflix or Amazon Prime, this is pretty much free.  For me, I decided to upgrade my internet from U-verse to Comcast because it was actually cheaper for me, and with with a 6 month intro offer, cheaper still.  I had cables already, but if you don't get those too.  And you're set. If you don't need the Cat5 cable, USB port or games ... then you could get the other models (3 of them), but I think the money is worth it just for the remote being RF instead of IR.I'll track this if you have any questions..

It's easy to use and I've never encountered a remote that's as simple to navigate as the Roku remote. I recommend looking around the web for some of the free, private channels because they don't appear in your on-screen menu of offerings. There are some excellent offerings. With Roku, there's no need for cable or satellite. You will still have to purchase content, in all likelihood, to get some TV shows (but, again, please check for private channels that you can add) but if you are buying a channel subscription for your Roku, that's because it's a channel you personally desire and that purchase isn't bundled with lots of other channels that you're not at all interested in. If you pay for something, you're only paying for what you want.This model has been replaced by a Roku 3 model. I happen to like the Hi-Res 1080p models AND having an ethernet port to connect my Roku player directly to my WAN connection (Internet router). As long as you're getting a model with those two key features, I highly recommend this..

This is a great internet entertainmaint device at a great price on Amazon. You can't really go wrong woth this if you are looking for internet content on your TV.The Not So Good Stuff: No digital audio outs, so if your receiver or TV don't do HDMI pass through, you're stuck with AV analog connections. This next bit is just a rant: VERY short list of playable external file formats. Which is ridiculous. It's not size, I have a MICCA media player that is smaller than this thing and will play just about anything I ask it to, including uncompressed AVI, VIDEO TS and ISO files. The exscuse is that those aren't &#34;streaming&#34; formats. Again, ridiculous. Using either the MICCA or old repurposed computers I can stream local content anywhere in the house. Not with the ROKU or any currently available channel apps. So if you're looking for a streaming device that will play ripped DVD's, look elsewhere or be prepared to convert everything to a &#34;portable&#34; format, the equivalent of digital video VCR, no menus, no extras, just the (compressed) movie file. Meh.The Weird Stuff: If the ROKU is on, and the computer that streams squashed files throuh PLEX is on, when they update each other they glitch the wireless on any other computer on the wireless network. So I unplug the ROKU, regardless of it's desire to &#34;stay updated&#34;, when not in use and that stopped the problem. Weird.The Bad Stuff: None. This is a great box for what it is and what you'll pay on Amazon. Plus it came with an HDMI cable!!

This isn't a long protracted reboot time but hey, who wants to reboot even ONCE? I plan to look around the house and see if I have a micro-SD card to expand its memory to see if that will help. If I find out anything, I'll update this. I have not tried other devices of similar function.

First, I was impressed by the compactness. This thing is not much bigger than can of cat food.  This is the kind of thing you can easily take on trip.  Other than a power light there is not much on this.  It comes with a basic analog audio/video cable, power cord, and remote (w/ batteries).  If you want HD, you need to buy an HDMI cable.I was able to connect this and create a Roku account in about 15 minutes.  Although the basic service is free, you have to give them a credit card number to create the account.  This is so they can charge you should you purchase any non-free things.  You can set up a PIN number that you need to enter to purchase, so your kids don't run up a bill without you knowing it.I linked this with Amazon and tested a couple of free Amazon Prime videos.  You have to have a Prime account for these to be free.  Despite the fact that I was going wireless, and using wireless-G, I was able to get a very good 1080p HD picture.  My daughter also played the Angry Birds game that came with it and worked very well, using the remote.In addition to Amazon Video you can get a 1 week free trial of Hulu or link it to your Netflix account.  There is also a channel store where you can get other channels such as Fandago or CNET.  There are quite a few of them to pick from, on all type of topics from guns to yoga. Some are free, some require a subscription fee.  You can also create channels for your social networks such as Facebook.  However, I tried to link it to my Flickr account, using the Flickr channel and got a weird error message.  I tried the WeatherUnderground channel. Wunderground as it is also known,  is by far the my favorite source of online weather. Roku knew what city I was in and showed weather, radar, etc.The cruising through the menus and movies choices is a slower than something like the XBOX for example.  You can't just zip through a list of movies. However the speed is acceptable, similar to what I get from DirecTV or a cable DVR.The remote is very basic. You have a 4-way rocker and 10 other buttons.  However it is fairly intuitive and work rather well.Overall I'm very impressed with the capabilities given the cost and ease of use.  I highly recommend this as a set-top streamer or gateway to the internet.  I will probably  buy a second one for our other TV. I wish I had gotten one of these sooner.Likes* Very small and compact* Great picture even with wireless* Many channels and movie/TV services to choose from* Easy setup and intuitive menusDislike* No HDMI cable included* A little slower than I'd prefer (but XBOX has spoiled me).

Besides this model, I also own theRoku 2 XD Streaming Player 1080p, and theThe Boxee Box by D-Link HD Streaming Media Player. Here is how the Roku 2 XS stacks up:Pros:+ low price (and a range of models to choose from to fit your needs and budget)+ largest number of premium Internet channels available: Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video, HBO Go, etc.+ Ethernet jack (XS only) AND 802.11n wireless (wifi)+ USB port for local content (basically, video files in H.264/MP4 format)+ video games!+ easy to set up+ easy to use+ more flexible than the AppleTV in terms of playing your own content and accessing Internet contentCons:- limited file format support, basically only H.264 MP4 files, for video playback (via the USB port)- cannot access network file shares without purchasing an additional channel/service, such as PlayOn- motion control is primitive- slow performance in Angry Birds- no AirPlay support, unlike the AppleTV (naturally) and the BoxeeBoxIf you are a techie, want to play a lot of local content--in many different file formats (AVI, MKV, etc.)--want to connect to file shares over your local network, and don't care about Hulu Plus, I recommend the BoxeeBox. You will pay a lot more, and have a device that is a little harder to use, with software that isn't as stable--but the capabilities of that device are outstanding. It even supports AirPlay now.If you buy everything through iTunes and want to sling video and audio from you iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch a lot via AirPlay, I recommend the AppleTV. You will pay the same as you would for this device, and would have a device that connects to Netflix, the iTunes Store, your iOS devices, and that's it.If you primarily want to watch videos from the Internet (from a TON of different places!), play a few games, and want something simple enough for the whole family to use (this is a HUGE plus!), get the Roku box..

I was wrong.  The HDMI connection goes both ways apparently and it works without any additional connections (although I already have other devices plugged into the TV through HDMI).  I also have a BluRay player that allows the use of apps much like the Roku 2 XS.  The quality of the signal is better with the BlueRay player, but it is not nearly as easy to use as the Roku 2 XS and seems to have a much more limited array of available apps than the Roku.  The only advantage of the BluRay player is that it has DLNA which allows wireless connection from my Asus tablet to the TV through the BluRay player.  The Roku 2 XS does not perform this function.

I'm not a heavy TV viewer, which means that when I do want to watch, I'm stuck troubleshooting connection issues for an hour or more instead. And then, if I'm lucky and still have time, I might actually get to watch something. When it works, it works fine. The problem is, that is not often.2. Roku is a security risk. Roku does not mask the router password, a not insignificant security risk / obstacle for those who care (of which I am one). Roku not only does not mask the router password, it 'remembers' any password it's ever been given. I discovered this quite by accident when Roku decided on its own to revert to a previous password.Search the Internet for 'Roku can't connect'. You'll find lots and lots of horror stories.

I have not subscribed to any paid programs except HuluPlus because of the poor reliability of this unit.

On the other hand, there are many channel options to explore that includes obscure tidbits such as German news programs, which my wife loves, and stuff like TED, yada yada...and it is great having Pandora run through my stereo.The remote is intuitive and works well, though sometimes when I try to navigate from tv to the Roku there is a delay (it may be updating). At one point I lost all connection (still not sure why) and needed customer support. After a five minute wait, the tech person via online chat walked me through getting it running again - so no complaints re tech support. I have no problems related to lags in the connection when streaming - the picture quality is great. In addition to being quite small, the Roku puck is surprisingly light and unobtrusive.

I find that the Roku is quicker and had more apps I could use (my TV is a samsung and it won't get Amazon Prime movies - they took it off their tvs last year right before I bought my Smart one.  I was very upset I spent all the $ to have a TV that could connect to the internet only to have it not work with the service I pay for!).I chose the XS because it has ethernet connection.  I have ethernet connections in all of our rooms and I'd rather connect through those for speed.  I do have one of them wireless and it works fine, but one of them it didn't (it's the farthest from my wireless access point so that's probably why).  I guess I can play Angry Birds on it with the special remote, but I don't :) .  That's a gee whiz feature for me.  I'm sure if my son ever figures it out it will get some use.  But for now our birds are happy and peacefully coexisting with the pigs...On one TV i did not have enough inputs so I have it on a HDMI switch3 Port HDMI Pigtail Switch with 55 cm HDMI Cableand that worked like a dream.  I have it shared with the dvd player, but have it as the lower priority - so as long as the dvd player is off the roku is the input.  But once i turn the dvd player on it takes priority as the input. I have had a few times where it hasn't recognized the roku right away, but turning the dvd player on and then off again does the trick.And, on one TV I don't use an HDMI cable (sold separately) I use the A/V cable that is included.

It was always tedious to navigate to the videos I wanted to watch.  Roku makes it all EASY!  You just plug in and do a very short configuration. You get a code, go online, and associate your Roku with your account.  Then you can download free and paid video.  It could not be simpler to use.  The remote has very few buttons.  It is very easy to learn the remote because there's so little to learn.  But it works great!I had bought the LT model for my  bedroom.  It worked so well I bought this model for the family room.  It works very well also.  I'm very pleased with this device that is easy to set up and easier to use.  We don't even need to turn on the computer that's connected to the TV anymore.One thing to know, there are some shows on HuluPlus that can only be viewed with a computer, not Roku.  I guess it has something to do with licensing.  But I know that "The Voice" cannot be watched on Roku.  I think you may be able to get one episode, but not certain.  Maybe we're missing something, I don't know.  But it seems like there is not as much content available on HuluPlus on the Roku as there is on the computer.I have not experimented with Roku XS much, but I know it can do more than I'm using it for.  It has a USB port where you can plug in a flash drive and watch a movie that is on the flash drive.  But the formats are limited.We're very pleased with this device.

I've had Apple TV for about a year.  I also stream through a TiVo HD DVR.  So I have some experience with these.Of the three, I find the Roku the most useful for streaming.  Apple TV is good for connecting my iPad/iPhone/iTunes wirelessly to my TV and A/V receiver.  The Roku has more overall flexibility, more channels to stream, and has a slightly better user interface in my opinion.  If I didn't use Apple products, I'd opt only for the Roku.  The TiVo doesn't come close in terms of streaming options.  I'll compare the Roku 2 to my Apple TV throughout this review.Setup took about 15 minutes through my Linksys based WiFi network operating at 2.4GHz.  I have it connected to my 32 inch LCD TV through the HDMI connector.  I feed an audio signal via separate audio cable from the Roku to my A/V receiver.  One downside to this is I get only 2 channel stereo to my receiver.  Apple TV has a digital optical output which feeds Digital Dolby to the receiver.  Definitely a plus for Apple TV.The Roku connected to my WiFi immediately after I entered my WiFi password.  I did have to register my passwords through the Roku with Pandora, Netflix, and Amazon Instant Video but that was straightforward.  Once connected to one of these services, streaming quality is excellent.  Netflix and Amazon stream HD content that equals my cable company HD signal in many cases.  Video quality varies by channel and is dependent on the quality of the source video, bandwidth from the individual channel provider, and the speed of my internet connection.  Roku compares favorably to Apple TV video quality.  Roku has a very slight edge at 1080P versus Apple TV's 720P all other things being equal.  My Roku 2 XS also has a USB port and micro-SDHC slot for additional memory.  Apple TV doesn't have these.  I've added an 8GB micro-SD card though I have no basis to compare how it improves the Roku's capabilities.I really enjoy Roku's Channel Store where I can download apps.  Downloadable games are also an option though I've only tried Angry Birds, a very addictive game.  It works fine on the Roku 2.  I can also download apps from other sources if I have their unique codes.  It is this capability I find to be the biggest advantage of the Roku over Apple's closed system.  For example, I can watch CNN International, BBC International, and numerous other live video news feeds.  Pandora, Tune-in radio, and other audio feeds beat Apple TV hands down.  Channels with free movie streams such as Crackle also abound.  Several channels stream classic movies from the 30s to 60s for free.  If Roku can continue to attract more channel providers, I have no doubt they will stay competitive with Apple.On the downside, I've had two screen freeze-ups in three weeks.  This happens while changing channels or backing out of a channel.  The screen simply freezes and the remote control has no effect despite the little light on the Roku blinking in response to my remote control signal.  I also have Roku's app on my iPhone and iPad and the Roku would not respond to either of these.  When this occurred, I had to unplug and plug my Roku back in.  This immediately solved the problem and the Roku rebooted fine.  This has not happened in over a year of use with the Apple TV.  I can live with this if the freeze-ups don't become more frequent.  If so, I'm still within Amazon's 30 day return window.Overall, I'm still very pleased with this Roku 2 XS.  It complements my Apple TV and provides more flexibility and variety in streaming channels than the Apple TV.  I intend to keep it unless I have more screen freezing issues..

ok so having that ethernet cable in the back of the device is actually a big deal (and annoying that you have to buy the highest price version to get that). the reason it's a big deal even if you have high speed internet and wireless is that (and you've probably noticed this) when you're on wireless at home it's definitely a good amount slower than if you're plugged into straight via the ethernet cord. just check on speedtest.net if you don't believe. this is course varies based on the security level you've set on your wireless. the more secure the slower. ok so onto the actual use of the device after the ethernet cable is plugged in and you see how small the box is. the setup is really quick. you actually have to get on our computer and go to roku.com/netflix or something like that to actually activate it which is sort of funny since the box is advertised as a streaming device that allows you to not use a computer. but seriously that's a serious nitpick. it took like 2 minutes. oh and clever roku makes you enter your credit card information in case you ever buy something. but they make it part of the signup process, clever clever but little annoying. don't worry i haven't been charged. they're legit on not screwing with you on this. the menu is good, not insanely great, but good. ok so now onto what really matters. how does the darn thing perform if you have a fast internet connection and the ethernet cable plugged in. beautiful is the answer, freaking beautiful. hasn't hickuped or slowed down once yet! i've only had it for about 4 days, but i've watched a lot of netflix since then. the box stays on all the time and i've heard people complain about it, but if you see the size of the box the thing barely uses any power so who cares. and plus it turns out to be a good thing because when i turn on my computer, bam it's on! so this review sounds i'm giving it a pretty good rating, so why did i give it 5 stars you ask. because i just like being a bit critical in general on these reviews. the reason i even bothered to write this review is because this device rules! love it. buy it. just make sure to follow my advice on even if you have fast internet connection to get the one with the ethernet plug (the xs). oh and if you're not sure if you have a high speed connection, you probably don't have one. go to speedtest.net. if it doesn't say like 4-5 mb download speed most of the time, it's not high speed. oh and the remote is pretty cool. oh and ignore the crap about angry birds, they actually use that as a selling point for the XS. it's stupid, not the game just the fact that's it's on there and used as a selling point. the XS model is good because of the ethernet port and because it plays HD content well. oh yeah totally forgot that. high definition content on netflix plays awesome. make sure of course you have an high definition television. i bought a high definition TCL tv for $328 on walmart.com and it works awesome on it. $328, isn't that insane. wait maybe they won't post the review now since amazon has the same tv in its electronics section. it's just that it was cheaper on walmart.com. but in general shopping on amazon is waaaay better. crazy how this device is $89 and the tv was $328. weird times. oh so last thing, cool little thing the box does. during the 1st few seconds of high definition content, it actually granulates the video just a pit (i.e looks low resolution) and then suddenly kicks into high definition. i think it does this to avoid putting up a buffering message. the logic being instead of showing the user a buffering message, just show lower quality video to the user while the device catches up and downloads the high def information is the background. clever i thought. would of course rather it just that right off the bat, but i'm good with it. so yeah roku roks! i'm not sure if apple tv is good, i'm sure it rules as well because well it's apple, but i don't know i guess i didn't look at it because i just assumed apple would loop me into this thing where i pay for every little thing i get through itunes, etc. ok so how was that short review, eh!

I had broadband access with a wireless router supplied by the cable company. The Roku did not work at first, very frustrating. There is a three step process involved with the Roku at start up. You either get a &#34;green&#34; light on each step if it works or a &#34;red&#34; light if a step doesn't. Got green on the first step, but red thereafter indicating no wifi connection.I never had an internet reception problem from my wireless router before this, but, I evidently did not have enough signal strength for this Roku device. It is very small, amazes me it can receive transmissions without any sort of external antenna. Anyway, long story short, bought and installed top of the line Netgear router... problem solved.When setting up the Roku, access to a computer is necessary. Codes are given on your tv screen, websites must be logged onto... You must be able to see and access your computer when you set up the Roku, it is an interaction. The Roku gives you a code word that has to be typed into the Roku website. They also require (on the website) credit card info, although nothing is charged to the card just to set up your Roku.You are then instructed how to add the channels you want at the &#34;channel store&#34;. Many are free, the Netflix and Amazon prime require you to be a member of their services, of course.I have not had any reception problems after installing the Netgear router. All channels seem to be very good reception without buffering problems.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the lack of info supplied with the Roku and the trouble determining what the problem was when I first tried to set it up. Red light? What is that? Green light? Now what do I do?  Do I have a defective device or is there another problem? Pretty much had to figure all that out on my own.Would I recommend?

Fine I will play that game. So I reformatted it. Then I plug it in and the movies need to be MP4... Find I will change those. Then after i convert the movies to a working format I plug it in and any movie around 800MB or lower works fine. Anything above that which if you have a big screen like me you need something that is at least around 2GB and when the file is that big the Roku box doesn't even want to open it or play it.

It basicially gives you access to HULU and Netflix streaming on your TV, in a very simple interface.  It does other stuff too, like let you see some free video sharing sites from the web, like YouTube and Justin.TV, etc., but I think most people will use this for Netflix and Hulu.  This also does exactly what XBox360 does without having to pay the annual fee of $60.  Coming soon it will have HBO GO available to HBO subscribers, which basically lets you stream all of their programming for free.It has flawless reception and is simply a brilliant idea.  I've never had any reception problems and the router is pretty far away (as in down stairs on the other side of the house).  I have been so impressed.  This is also so easy-to-use and it was easy to set up.  I pretty much just intuitively knew what to do.  This is a must buy for anyone looking for this type of product.  It's also very small and easy to hide behind a TV or other components.  I just can't say enough good things about this little box..

Since I have both, I'm going to compare the two for those of you deciding whether to get one or both.AppleTV has a much tighter and more beautiful user experience. If you're a heavy iTunes user, AppleTV will seamlessly stream your music, video, and photos (from iPhoto, Aperture, or Flickr) to your television. This is important to me and the Roku doesn't do this.The AppleTV starts to fall short when you want to access content outside of the Apple ecosystem. This is where the Roku starts to shine. While Apple's Netflix streaming interface and quality is the best I've seen, Roku isn't limited to Netflix. My Roku will stream Amazon Prime Videos, Crackle, and dozens of other free, video sources. Because of this feature, I cancelled my paid Netflix streaming account. Without Netflix, I use my AppleTV exclusively for accessing iTunes content.For music, the Roku has lots of options including Pandora and Soma FM. I use these options frequently. AppleTV supports my iTunes collection and outside of hooking your computer up to your system, the only other simple way to get iTunes streaming is to buy an Airport Express (for about the same price as the AppleTV).If you have an iPad or iPhone, AppleTV will let you use AirPlay with apps that support it, so you can get content from these devices onto your tv. You iPad and iPhone will also act as robust remotes for the AppleTV.With the Roku, you get an advanced remote that lets you play games. The Angry Birds integration is fun and the remote works well. Some reviewers have complained about the unit having memory problems, so I immediately added a 2GB micro SD card I had. I haven't had any problems.The Roku XS lets me customize which channels I receive--both by selecting the ones I want and deleting the ones I don't (to reduce clutter). AppleTV doesn't have anything like this. It is very much a closed system.MY RECOMMENDATIONSIf you're primary purpose is to get content from iTunes or your Apple iPad or iPhone onto your TV, enjoy Netflix, and don't mind a closed system, then get the AppleTV.If you're interested in streaming video from multiple sources, particularly Amazon Prime Videos, and aren't a heavy iTunes user, then absolutely get the Roku XS. It's more flexible than the AppleTV.If you're like me, you might want to get both. They're small, support different use cases, and open your system up to so much content you may be able to cancel some paid subscription plans and easily pay for the two in no time.. The summary for the 40825 is Roku XS or AppleTV or Both?

The main difference among other models is 1080p resolution, built-in Ethernet port, and a free Angry Birds game. Like the other Roku models, the 2XS has a growing library of channels that include Netflix, Amazon, Flixter, Crackle, NBC, AOL, and a big selection of user-made private channels.InterfaceAll Roku devices use the same simple interface. Channels are represented in a horizontal grid, and once a channel is selected, further grids of selections are then displayed. This barebones sort of presentation means anyone can understand it, but finding any particular show requires many button presses.ContentNetflix, Amazon Instant Video, and Hulu Plus require a paid subscription, but they have the best selection of TV shows and Movies. These channels cost about $6-$10 a month each, and they have a side benefit of being accessed from your mobile phone, tablet, or computer - not just from the Roku device. The Roku also has a lot of free channels that come from Internet-famous websites like Cnet, Giantbomb, Chow, Crunchyroll and more. (Unfortunately, Youtube is not officially supported as of yet.)Lastly, there are the private channels which are made by the enthusiast community. These channels vary in scope, but the wide range of subject matter can be surprising. There's channels devoted to late night tv, sports, specific sitcoms, firearms, cars, tech, gaming, and more. Best of all, most of the private channels are free. (As of Dec. 2011, there was a Youtube channel available as a private channel, but that was pulled because Google did not sanction it. Roku however, has stated it is working with Google to bring an official Youtube channel to the device.)If you care a lot about sports, the Roku might not meet your needs. There are Football, Baseball, and Basketball channels, but they tend to not to be live broadcasts - most are pre-recorded. Cable and satellite TV is still a better choice in this regard.QualityGoing with the wifi connection on the Roku won't be as consistent as using its Ethernet connection. I often get varying degrees of quality even though the Roku's status says that its wireless connection is "good." And if you use the Roku a lot, you could run the risk of hitting your data limit that your ISP allows. (I typically get to about 200-220 gigs of data in a month, which is about 80-90% towards my own limit.)ConclusionIf you are thinking of replacing cable or satellite TV with this - it maybe a good alternative for you. However, it all depends on what content you want. In my case I opted to keep the most basic cable package so I could still get local channels. (There is a private channel on the Roku that has local channels, but the quality of the broadcasts vary.) The Roku then, provides the rest of my viewing content, and I am happy with it. I still miss the live broadcasts of sports from around the country, and having my favorite shows in consistent 1080p resolution was always great with digital cable tv. But Roku allows me to save a lot of money (cut my bill in half!) and still have most of the shows I care about..

Roku gives me access to a bunch of free channels too like old western movies and news.With the 100 a month I am saving now from dish, I bought a TV tower and antenna to get all the locals.

It handles the videos perfectly, it even gives descriptions on each movie, showing it like a full library.The wireless is fantastic, streaming HD videos in crystal clear quality.On top of all this, the electric footprint of the device is so low, that it technically doesn't have an off switch. It goes into a sleep mode when not being used, and sits there the whole time.

Some of the channels have somewhat lame programming, but there are a few quality ones and it's a relatively cheap solution for Netflix if you already have a DVD player and don't want to buy one with Netflix built in.

But it's use hasn't been blocked from us, which I give major kudos for.  The DPI on this thing, at max setting is going to be unusable for most ordinary PC users, and even most PC gamers.  This is a pure Gaming mouse - more for Korean baang sessions than anything.  So super-high DPI is necessary for that level of competitive gaming.  High level PC gamers, like expert Starcraft BW or LoL types, will find the DPI here a godsend.  This is a lovely mouse for pimped out gaming rigs.This would also explain the constant blue LEDs that will not power down from a USB, even when your PC is powered down.  This is a LAN thing; you want the glowing blue lights in a darkened LAN room.  You can get around the constant LED with a power strip I/O switch.  Of course, not all power strips have a power switch built in, so take that in mind if you buy one.Overall, this mouse is one of the best gaming mice I've used in all my years of PC gaming.  You could go Razer or Logitech - heck even high-end Microsoft with your game mice and get a pleasant experience.  But for the price of this E-Blue you'll get a much better deal.  It'll take some time to get to you (it's a import) but when it does you'll be pleased with the performance..

From what I've read this is the result of microswitch failure and there is no way to repair or work around it, the mouse is just garbage once that happens. I've only owned the mouse for a couple months so I tried to contact the manufacturer about a replacement. Their website doesn't have any mention of customer support or warranties even though this mouse is listed as having a 1 year warranty. The only way I could find to contact them was through the one email address they have listed on the site, and I did so. That was about a week ago and I've received no response from the manufacturer, at this point it seems very unlikely that I'll ever hear from them.I gave the mouse 2 stars because it's very inexpensive and looks neat.I also liked that the mouse wheel is not a smooth mouse wheel, you can actually feel soft clicks as you turn it. It is kind of hard to get used to using the mousewheel as a middle button but still a lot easier than with my microsoft mobile mouse that has a smooth mousewheel. With the MS smooth mousewheel what happens is that as you go to click the middle button, the wheel spins slightly and this prevents the click from being registered correctly. Not so much of a problem with the cobra's clicky mousewheel but still worse than the basic MS mice which actually have the most usable wheel/middle click functionality.Bottom line: Buy it only if you like the way it looks so much that you're willing to keep replacing it every couple of months. I'll be moving on to something that's made by a company who stands behind their products..

I have lots of videos and photos saved and my other drives were getting a bit full. I used this drive to put the more archival (less-often used) items from the other drives. Among the benefits of reducing the amount of data in my C drive (and desktop) is a much faster boot-up time.The drive was easy to install and I did it myself. Not bad for a 65-year old grandmother, if I do say so myself.You need to be sure that you have a power cable available on your motherboard (which I did); a slot to put the drive into (which I did); a place on your motherboard to plug in a data cable (which I did); and a data cable which isn't included w/the drive  ( I got it  at CompUSA for a couple of dollars).You disconnect your computer from the wall, and open it up. You just slide the drive into the slot and screw it in, connect the power cable to it, clip on the data cable to the drive, plug the other end into the slot on the motherboard, close up the computer, turn it on, and Windows7 immediately recognizes that you have new hardware. (If it doesn't, just go to Computer Management).I was surprised at how easy it was and amazed at what a difference it makes to not have all your other drives full to near capacity. My computer is 3-years old and I figure that I've added considerably to its durability, efficiency, and usefulness by giving myself this extra storage..

Ran the ATTO bench, got 210MB/s.NOTE: This review is for the 2TB Barracuda, however I also get 210MB/s with the 1TB version.I feel like I need to edit this review a little bit.First off: if anyone has any problems with their drive showing up DOA, it is probably due to bad shipping. I have never had a problem with Amazon purchases showing any signs of damage. People have said they found their CPU tins bent or crushed, and monitors cracked - but I haven't had a single problem. I don't think many of these reviews for damaged hard drives - from any company - are due to poor product. Hard drives may be the hardest to ship safely, and may have the highest DOA rate.Reaching 210MB/s is quite high from the benches I have seen. I don't know why people pay $250 for a 300GB HDD that has 180MB/s.I don't know how your drive will turn out, but if it arrives DOA, get Amazon (or who ever you bought from) to take it back, and use a different mail service.I also love how the HDD is just as silent as my 1TB Barracuda (ST1000DM 003-9YN162) and has twice the capacity. I can't hear either of them over my case fans, and even then the house has to be dead quiet for me to hear my computer at all. My fans kick up during gaming, but I have the speakers on.

My main PC is connected to the livingroom TV as a third display, so I keep two keyboards and two pointing devices in use on that machine.Generally I don't mind a non-full-sized keyboard, provided it's not too small, and I find I can type full-speed on this one quite easily. Other positive reviews have covered pretty much everything, but there is one HUGE mistake in the design of this model, so I felt it needed more exposure.If you type fairly well, your fingers know where the shift keys are. But on this keyboard, the designers made an incredible mess of things by moving the right shift key one position to the right. Worse yet, the key in the proper shift position is an UP arrow, so when you hit it by mistake, instead of starting a new sentence, you move the cursor up one line and make a complete mess.I look at it this way: the designer, who obviously doesn't type on normal keyboards very much, thought that UP and DOWN should be nicely centered between LEFT and RIGHT. Sure, fine, that looks great. But how often to you need to find the UP key by touch alone? It has no "standard" position anyway!And how often do you start typing a sentence? Or a shifted character (like the !) that uses the right shift? The arrows would have worked fine with UP/DOWN to the right, or with just the UP arrow to the right, or with some other approach to nestling these four keys into the compact layout. But instead, one of the most-often used keys on the keyboard is in a completely non-standard position, which makes no sense at all.If you happen to type a lot, and fast, this shift key position thing will drive you nuts. If you don't type much at all, you probably won't care.If only Logitech could provide a setup feature to swap positions for those two keys (just for this keyboard -- I definitely don't want them swapped on any of my normal-layout keyboards), it would solve the problem quite nicely. I've already tried 3 key-macro and remapping apps, but (a) they affect all keyboards on the computer, and (b) most of them can't remap the arrow keys -- or if they can, it's incredibly inconvenient. Or once mapped, you have to reboot the computer and then reboot again when you're done. So the problem remains, and it looks like only Logitech can solve it..

The by-now-elderly original iMac keyboard worked fine, yes, but there just isn't that much space on my desktop, and my KVM wasn't really up to the task either. This, on the other hand, proved to be perfect.The standard Logitech wireless dongle is very low-profile and fits into the RPi's USB port without sticking out too far, and it doesn't get in the way of anything you might put in the second port; that's about all you can ask, and it delivers beautifully. The layout is a little strange, but you pick it up quick; among other things, the trackpad is in a somewhat odd location, a little higher up on the keyboard than you'd expect, and it sometimes gets a little confusing if you're used to laptop trackpads. I did find that Raspbian, at least, doesn't seem to support the control functions of the keyboard, at least not out of the box, but that's not really a Logitech issue. Basically, if you have an application where you might want to keep your RPi out of sight but occasionally pull out a keyboard for whatever reason, this might actually be the best choice on the market.On the other hand... well, since Logitech doesn't officially support using this keyboard on Macs, I won't dock a star for it, but it works, albeit behaving a little oddly at times. The layout is pretty alien to OS X so you may find some functionality muddled or missing. Also, since this isn't a Bluetooth device, you wind up using up a USB port, which is kind of a waste. It will work fine, overall, but I wouldn't bother if you can get a Mac-specific design.Now, as for its intended platform... it's a standard Windows keyboard, so it should do just fine. Overall, it should be a good choice for most purposes..

Yes, it is larger than a "mini keyboard," but not so big that it won't easily fit in a drawer. The touchpad works great (all the "mini keyboard" touchpads seem jumpy), and it is easy to type on. You also don't have to do all sorts of keystroke contortions to do something like a simple Ctrl-Alt-Del. Backlighting would be nice, but it would also chew up the battery, and I rarely watch TVs or movies in the complete dark. I don't miss any media controls since I use the K400 in conjunction with a Logitech Harmony One remote.If you can live without backlighting and dedicated media keys (though you can map the F keys to various functions in the Logitech Setpoint software), and get past the size, this is a great alternative.

Also, the signal strength seemed quite weak even though I was only about 15 feet away from my HDTV.  I think they may get it right on the next iteration.I would have liked to try the mini DiNovo but it was either out of stock or a bit pricey.Back to the Logitech!  The keyboard is very light and sits comfortably in the lap.  I use it to watch movies on my HTPC via VLC/XBMC and online streaming (Amazon, etc), play some games on Steam (doesn't replace a mouse with FPS games!) and web browsing.  It takes a little time to get used to the trackpad, but there are a couple of nice Windows 8 gestures like pinch to zoom, etc which are a nice touch.I was initially against buying a keyboard of this size since I wanted to minimize space and consolidate to two remotes.

So far it has worked very well with random times when the touchpad gets really slow. At first I though it was the battery but after changing to new batteries I think it might just be some sort of temporary signal loss. Besides this I love this keyboard. It's small enough to use with my home system, but not tiny where it will just get lost. It still has that sort of full size keyboard size without being too large. The touchpad works great with Windows 8. It provides for multi-touch use seamlessly with windows. I also like the feature of using two fingers to expand or contract the size of webpages when using a browser.I use it with my desktop with the included USB dongle (note that this is not a Bluetooth keyboard). I use it about 5-6 feet away from the USB receiver and works well. Two other convenience factors are the "Lock PC" button that locks the PC in Windows 8 without the hassle of the Start button and the ON/OFF switch in the back to conserve battery power. It also has volume buttons that work perfectly.Overall, for the price and small size this is a great keyboard especially for home entertainment purposes. Now, if you want to write a book or report this may not be for you. For that purpose I keep a regular full size USB keyboard attached to the desktop. Five stars for a great product.Pros:- Small- Great for Windows 8- Volume Control- PC Lock Button- Integrated Touchpad- ON/OFF switchCons:- Signal loss on touchpad- Not great for extensive writing.

In general, the keys seemed to feel too small. I'm used to typing on laptop keyboards and tend to actually prefer them, but this keyboard's keys just seemed to small when typing. I'd often hit adjacent keys and could probably adjust but the second issue was the deal breaker:2.) The right shift key is way too small for my typing style. I was constantly missing the key or having to hunt for it, and that proved to be too much of a pain for me to continue to use the keyboard.Pros:1.) The touchpad was very responsive and easy to use. It also seemed to be placed in a good spot.2.) The keyboard is very small and light.3.) The keyboard is designed so that it could be used with a television and off a desk. The design allows for you to hold the keyboard with your main fingers and use the touchbpad with your right thumb and the "left-click" button with your left thumb. This would be very useful if using this with a computer that was connected to a television and you were, say, on the couch.4.) The price seems very reasonable to the product delivered..

So many wireless keyboards missed off this feature making them useless for what I was looking for.After using the product for about 3 months, I think this is a perfect way to control the PC. The trackpad is responsive and works OK with the dubious interfaces of Windows 8. The keyboard isn't the best, but then I'm not going to be doing much typing on a computer set-up such as this. The battery life must be pretty good as it's not run out yet. I have never had any issues of the keyboard not being detected.

You can turn off touchpad clicking entirely via the software, but I would much rather have a sensitivity adjustment.

The beautiful thing about a Nexus 10 is that it is so easily unlocked and modified. With this keyboard I can use my Nexus 10 as a laptop.

Just plug in the provided wireless receiver dongle into an available USB port, turn on the keyboard, and bam - PC recognizes the keyboard and mouse functions without a problem.This is a wireless battery operated keyboard that works via radio signal not IR, so you do not have to worry about having line-of-site to a receiver.

Amazon's better care package with air bags. 2. The keyboard was so soft to touch although it's smaller than what I expected. 3. The keyboard is so light and convenient to carry, so I can use it anywhere in my living room. 4. the touch pad of the keyboard is so sensitive as a replacement of a wired mouse.Thanks Logitech and Amazon for the second keyboard..

I did not expect it to be so heavy to move around. I'm amazed that no one has said this on another review since this mouse is way heavier than any other mouse I have used in my life, which includes desktop mouse way bigger than this one. Anyways, I paid for it and I'm not in a position where I can return it so I will try to adjust to its weight and I will update the review accordingly if my mind is changed. Works well on Ubuntu Linux: I just plugged the unifier and it was all set. The scroll wheel is very soft, different from mouses I have used before but is something that you should get used to or could later prefer (again, I'll update this review later after I have used the mouse more).UPDATE 03/09/2013: Using a very smooth surface the heaviness of the mouse is less noticeable. I tested a mouse pad from a coworker which had a VERY smooth surface and the mouse felt way lighter to move, that's why I bought that same mouse pad but I wasn't expecting I had to buy a premium mouse pad (almost the same price for which I got the mouse, I'm going to link to it once it arrives and I can test it more throughly) to use this mouse, which adds to the price I originally intended to spend.The scrolling wheel is definitely a sticking point of this mouse, I love the way it feels. Apparently you can adjust it's settings using the logitech software (available on their website) but since the default one is fine by me I haven't log on to windows to change them. Once I try it out I'll update this review.UPDATE 12/01/2013: The mouse has been signaling poor battery (red power indicator light) for about two weeks now. When this happens I open the battery case and move the battery around and it goes back to show the green light again (source: TV remote usage LOL). This is just in order for me to see how much can the OEM battery go before it is completely drained out. After this I will then insert a new Duracell one and report back here in order to assess if the OEM battery inflates the battery life expectancy using this mouse.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the battery life, I never expected to get the 18 months logitech promises. Getting 9 months is in line with what I expected, it certainly beats the ~3 weeks battery life expectancy of the rechargeable ones Logitech sells (source: a coworker has one).UPDATE 01/19/2014: The battery that came with the mouse just died, after more than a month of the mouse flashing the red light instead of the green one (also, of me applying every trick I knew to get every bit of energy out of the battery). In short, your battery will never die before giving you ample of time to change it. The mouse gave me about 10 months of use in total so I'm very happy with it.For Linux users, in the new version of ubuntu (14.10) the OS recognizes the mouse battery life information so if the battery is dying (as was my case when I tested it) it informs you with a little mouse icon in red the system tray. This was a surprise for me because I still use 12.10 but had to boot up the 14.10 live CD to do some things and noticed it. Nothing life changing but it is a good little detail, bravo ubuntu team! (other distros my have this capability too)..

You can even apply pressure to the scroll wheel sideways, left or right, to get additional functionality (browser back page and forward page, by default in Windows). The transceiver part that stays in the USB port is quite small and I won't have to remove it when I put my laptop into a carrying case.Update 11/3:  Good:  great range on the wireless signal;  Bad:  the right button is so sensitive, I cannot rest my finger on it without clicking it.

With the Microsoft one, you get the wheel set just right for say Yahoo email and then it goes too slow (or too fast--scrolling that is) in a regular website or in Word. Get it set just right in one of those, and then sucks for how it works somewhere else.  I'm not sure why, except the Microsoft mouse wheel has clicks that are much "larger" if you will, and getting them adjusted right so they do not move too much or too little is quite a pain, and then you are compromising between types of windows you are in. 3) this is the one that really prompted me replacing my Microsoft mouse that is similar: The buttons have too strong a spring for my taste, so you really have to press a lot harder than on this Logitech. That gets old, especially on alternate click. The Microsoft model has ONE advantage, though. The receiver dongle fits nicely into the bottom of the mouse itself for travel.  It does on this Logitech one, also, but you have to open the batter door to stick it in there. On Microsoft model, you just insert it into a space and you click a button to release it. However, this is not a big deal and the door to open for batter and to insert dongle is very well made and works well on this model by Logitech.  HIGHLY recommend this mouse..

It feels weightless and is surprisingly comfortable for being such a low-profile keyboard.There are two issues with the product: first, the keys can lag a bit when you start typing. Often you have to repeat the first letter of a word and correct one or two mistakes per minute if you type really fast. Second, the keyboard takes a while to connect with your computer when booting up or waking up out of sleep mode. I imagine these problems are related.For Mac users, you can mitigate the typing issues by speeding up the response time under system preferences. Of course, this isn't possible on a mobile device.I've used official Apple Bluetooth products and run across similar issues.

Unlike the later Acer Tablet models, the A100 does not have a USB host controller and and so its USB plug in does not handle many things, including a mouse, keyboard, or hard drive.  When I researched online, I was surprised to find reviews of other bluetooth keyboards coming defective.  I wanted to find a keyboard with a good review already and saw this one had a 4.5 star average with a large number of people reviewing it and being happy.  The keyboard came quickly and arrived unbroken and well packaged.  I liked that it used 2 AAA batteries (not included) to power it, because some bluetooth devices I read about needed to be scrapped when their lithium battery went out, which happens soon with the often heavy use of some of these devices.  I got two bluetooth headsets for my brother and both suffered this fate.  There is a small on/off switch on the back and a "connect" button to pair the device with the tablet.  The connect button needs to be pressed by pen or stylus as it is small and slightly recessed.  I turned on my tablet (Android OS 3.0+), went to the bluetooth device manager screen, turned on the Anker keyboard, pushed the connect button, and the tablet found it and paired it with no problem.  I then went to my gmail account and typed an email response to a email I had received.  I was able to type at my usual 90 wpm speed.  The keys felt good and were a comfortable near normal size.  It does everything that I wanted to and more.A few minor notes:  The Amazon write up says that the "esc" key does not work.  It does on the A100 and serves to leave the screen to go back to a main screen.  I notice that the keyboard layout seems to be more "Mac" or "Apple" style.  Some keys do not have any special response on the A100 that look Mac specific.  I take this feature the same way as some remotes that are designed for more than one device and also have extra keys that you do not use.  The keyboard driver automatically disables the onscreen keyboard, so you cannot use both at the same time (which is more than okay to me).  I did not test how far you can be from the tablet and still get keyboard response.  I assume that the range is more than adequate for any typing where you are close enough to see the tablet screen.  I would recommend keeping the box for protection and transport.  The box also has some contact data for support..

They are a bit louder than the standard wired and wireless Apple keyboard found on the Mac Pro and Macbook Pro. The letters appear to be little stickers instead of laser-etched like high end mechanical keyboards.The T300 is a basic copy of the Apple wireless keyboard but at a much lower price. It includes an on/off switch on the back which is great to save battery.My only gripe comes either from the keyboard itself or bluetooth in general. Say, I am typing on this with my iPad for several seconds then take a small break, say to take a sip of my coffee, the keyboard/iOS goes into battery saving mode and I need to press any key more once then start typing before I see letters on the screen.Now, it could be the fact that I am not pressing hard enough on the keyboard itself but again, I am not sure. It is not a HUGE pain, hence why I am still give the keyboard 5 stars, just a little annoying in some cases.I would definitely recommend this keyboard for one not wishing to pay for Apple's but want something that mimics the same form factor.The company sells a windows mechanical keyboard as well, if they made a Mac one, I'd pick it up in a heart beat, Anker is just that good!.

But, I later discovered, after some messing around with it, that while it pairs perfectly with my laptop and my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, it does go into a sort of "sleep" mode, like computers have, and if you started typing on it, it would start to wake up again.

It's the same size as the standard sized keyboard you would get on most laptop computers, so if you are already used to that size keyboard this will feel natural to you. The action of the keys are also identical to what you would expect on a laptop keyboard. Syncing with your mobile device via bluetooth is very simple. There is a battery light which indicates when keyboard is syncing to mobile device and also will let you know when the batteries need replacing. works with standard AAA batteries.I bought this as a portable keyboard, but upon receiving it found it to be too large to be considered protable in most cases. If you normally carry a backpack or large purse with you then perhaps it will be portable for you.

Slightly flimsy but sturdy enough to type on it seems. That's as much as I was able to evaluate, as the keyboard that was sent to me was DOA.While putting fresh AAA batteries in the keyboard and turning the switch on, then pressing the small connect button did nothing. I swapped out a few different pairs of batteries to no avail.I did however, take a digital multimeter to the battery terminals to check if there was at least a circuit being made with the switch in both the on and off selection. The result was exactly as expected. A circuit was being made with the switch on but no circuit with the switch off. This suggests to me, that there is an issue within the electrical components in the keyboard fed by the power supply and not with the power supply itself.I know the risk of buying cheap Chinese knockoffs, so I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed as this was a gift for my wife for her new iPad.As usual, Amazon return process is quick and painless so I will be looking for another bluetooth keyboard, probably in a higher price range.

Size-wise, it's smaller than the Logitech AAA-powered keyboard, and about the same size as Motorola's built-in battery bluetooth keyboards. It is just the keyboard, no included cover/stand as some others have. It doesn't have a trackpad or mouse either. This is fine, as it's also very inexpensive compared to most alternatives.The keyboard has no fold-out feet but is naturally angled a bit due to the battery compartment. It runs on two AAAs. Pairing was straightforward and the key quality is good.Having used both this and the built-in rechargeable battery variants, I'd say it's a tossup which is better. The rechargeable ones tend to be a bit thinner, but are more expensive- and it can be a plus to be able to just swap batteries. Versus the much larger Logitech Tablet Keyboard, it depends on whether you feel comfortable typing with a small chicklet keyboard vs. a full size. Additionally, the convertible cover/stand is useful if you have a large tablet that doesn't have one. However, once again- this Anker model is a lot cheaper, it's very hard to beat the price in general..

They sent out a new keyboard at their expense.  Sadly this one did connect but the space bar doesn't work.  They obviously have some quality control issues to work out.UPDATE 2: (KEYBOARD #3)So they sent another one (man, they are workin' for it) and three times must be the charm because this one seems to work fine.  I will update again after using it for a while.Update 3: (Good for mobil devices, Bad for PCs)So I have used this keyboard for a while now.  It still works, however, it "goes to sleep" to soon causing the first letter of what you are typing to be ignored until it wakes up if you pause to do something else.  So this is great for mobil devices but for a laptop sitting on your desk I should have got a full size, full featured BT keyboard.  I am changing my rating from 1 star to 2 stars because of initial experience (3 keyboards) but this vendor was great about follow up am trying to satisfy me.  Kudos to Anker for that!Update FINAL:After using this keyboard with my Win 8 laptop for several months now I am surprised I haven't bashed it with a hammer...YET!  When I get around to getting a replacement the hammer WILL fall.

My iPad Mini found the keyboard without fuss and in a matter of five key presses, I was ready to use the keyboard in my favorite word processor. While resembles an Apple wireless keyboard, the Anker is made of all plastic. It is a sturdy device, however, and it holds up well to the finger abuse. The keys are big enough where even the beefiest fingers can type accurately, yet the whole keyboard is less than ten inches long. The function keys control various functions of the iPad. Admittedly, I am still experimenting with the keyboard, but so far the experience has been nothing short of positive.If I have any complaints about the device -- and you would be hard pressed to find something to gripe about -- it would be the battery cover.

The sleep/wake feature also works perfectly and is a really cool feature.The only thing that really sucks about this case, is that fact that I hated the inconsistent lighting on my Kindle Paperwhite, and I returned it to Amazon.

I tried it on the next day and it fits perfectly.  There was only one problem, my Kindle Paperwhite didn't turn on due to the magnet position.  I immediately contacted the seller and explained my problem.  Within minutes, I got a reply to reorder the item and a "NEW" one will be shipped to me at no cost to me including EXPEDITED shipping cost.  I reordered the item and after it shipped, received an email from Amazon saying that my full refund had been issued.  Got my new case on the 19th, tried it on and it, of course, fits perfectly!  I noticed that the magnets are rectangular and are in different positions now.  Works like a charm.  My Kindle Paperwhite turns on and off as expected.The case looks very professionally made, unlike a gazillion other cases that look so ugly with corn straps that I wouldn't put on my Kindle.  This case looks absolutely gorgeous opened or closed.  It provides protection all the way around and does not cover any part of the screen.  It wraps perfectly around the bezel like it's supposed to and looks absolutely stunning.  When closed, it actually automatically turns off the Kindle.  I know it does because the Kindle Paperwhite has built in light.  When closed, the light turns off and the Kindle goes to sleep.  I verified this in the dark.  The newer case comes with rectangular magnets that keeps the front cover closed when you close the Kindle and it also puts the Kindle to sleep.  The OLDER case has rounded magnets at the corners.  That older case with round magnets was the problem, but the newer case with rectangular magnets are just perfect.10 stars to the seller, BSCstore and 10 stars for this excellent case!

The kindle slips in from the top and a little leather flap goes over it and slides between the back of the kindle and the back of the case.

The inside of the cover has a velour feel to it and includes a built-in flap to store a business card or whatever. The magnetic closure works every time and also holds the cover in place when folded flat against the back. Too many of the covers I have seen are too stiff to fold the top back completely but this one lays flat. It is well-designed and gives the kindle just enough heft to feel comfortable holding with one hand. When I first got it, I thought it was too thick but, the more I used it, the more I realized that the size is just right. If I had to buy another cover, this is the one I would choose.

Rather than buy locally I checked Amazon and was surprised to find that most styli come in packs of 6 to 10 but the prices are quite affordable. So, even if the tip comes off I have 5 more styli in a variety of colors. Only had mine about a week and am very pleased with the stylus.

The colors are bright, metallic and look exactly as pictured. Very light weight (I have some that are lighter, but not by much). Easy to handle, but I noticed that they are slightly heavier near the tip end, just enough to make them feel unbalanced, but not a big issue.The packaging is outstanding. Each pen is in it's own clear sleeve. They are all packed in a very nice clear plastic zip lock bag. Also included are two long lanyards that stretch and attach very nicely to the earbud jack on a tablet or smartphone. My only complaint is they are exceedingly difficult for me to attach to a stylus. It took several frustrating attempts. It's not a big deal, but in my opinion it would have been much better to have a loop (like on most small camera lanyards) instead of the very tiny, slippery wire ring. The kit also included a cleaning cloth for touch screens in it's own zip lock bag.I am very happy with the seller's obvious interest in my satisfaction shown by an email with helpful links and contact information in case of a later problem.

I had an Amazon Basic 16 gig card. I traveled this country and took pictures of things that will last forever and moments that I will never get again. And it never failed me, until it failed me. I was helping film a video, had multiple angles shot and spent 3 hours getting everything as god as possible so the editing process would be easy. Then, poof, card not accessible. Computer doesn't even see it. Gone. So, I tossed it, mutterered a lot and offered a lot of apologizes and then bought this SanDisk 64gig that so happened to be on sale. Thus far, it's been perfect, while it does write a little slow when I get exteremely shutter release happy (Canon T3i) it takes a stalled second to write the RAW format, this card has been wonderful. I normally walk around with multiple 16gig's. Now, just this card, (and the others in case of failure). But so far, besides the slight pause in record speed it's fine. I'm sure if you were taking Large Superfine JPEG's you would'nt run into the problem. But if you are taking 29mb Raw files, hit that button 10 times and around 7 it starts to lag.

Previously I had been using Wintec's 16gb because they were inexpensive and apparently very reliable.  But now that I have tried these SanDisk Ultra's I am more inclined to go with them.Only two things interest me in the SDHC arena:  1) reliability, 2) speed.  So far I have had no failures with any SDHC so there are no obvious brands to avoid.  But the SanDisk Ultra is noticeably faster (without even having to rely on benchmarking) than my other cards.  More importantly it kept up with my DSLR video efforts without faultering or rendering a scene with skips (due to being busy).Of course it is a few dollars more expensive than the other class 10 cards I was buying (and I have over a dozen of them) but for the speed and better rendering of video, it is worth it.  Time will be needed to determine reliability, but for now the Ultra is my new go to card.Hints for helping your SDHC remain reliable:1) format the card with the camera (not with the computer) before ever using it2) copy images from the card to the computer, never "move" them and never allow the computer to delete anything from the card3) when the photographer is ready to erase all the images from the SDHC use the camera and do a low-level format.

It took about one half an hour to get up and running, including a check to make sure my devices could access the Internet. But that's TWC's fault, not the modem.A SpeedTest of this modem showed that it could achieve the same download speed as the old modem, which is due to TWC using software to ensure my bandwidth doesn't exceed what I'm paying for (up to 20 Mbps). My upload speed actually more than doubled, going from 0.8 Mbps to just over 2.0 Mbps.

We were pleasantly suprised when it went flawlessly with our cable co. here to "provision" our modem, what a great suprise as this was a gift to my son. I do have to be honest with everyone who reads this though as I am a honest man and a "semi-pro" tech head myself. The 3.0 technology didn't blow me away compared to the older 2.0 modem we were using. We increased our speed from 1.5 MPS to 15.0 MPS and of course that made the difference for sure, but don't think 3.0 is the holy grail or anything. The modem so far has functioned properly, it is VERY small in size, really small, which is good since it can fit anywhere. This one has ONE ethernet port only and we added a "HUB" or ethernet switch box ourselves to handle up to 5 ports. Lastly, you cannot use you broadband phone through this modem !!!!!!.

The old Ubee (assembled in VietNam) DOCSIS 3.0 Modem I have been renting from them is a little tired and I am tired of paying the $7/month rent so I purchased the Motorola SB6141. I did a speed test before I changed out the modem and I was getting 60MBs down and 16MBs up with 15 ms of latency. I replaced the modem and Comcast set it up and it connected without any issue and I got 24MBs down and 3.5MBs up with 19ms of latency. So, I called Comcast back and asked them to check my signal and tier level to make sure they hadn't accidentally changed anything. They reset my modem from their office and I manually power cycled it. Same numbers. So I had them set me back up with the Ubee modem and when I tested it, I got the speed I was getting before I changed everything out. 63MBs down and 16MBs up with a 15ms ping to their local servers. I setup a service call, and I will have their tech setup the Motorola modem but my guess is that I'm sending this puppy back. UPDATE: A Comcast tech came out and verified my signal. However, I finally got Comcast to upload the CORRECT BOOTFILE and now I am getting the same speeds I got with the rental Ubee modem. I was hoping for an increase in speed, but I'm happy with the speeds I have been getting. Now I can return the rental modem back to Comcast and save that $7/month..

I did the math. It seems they want to charge me $60 a year for $40 modem. After researching all five modems on their approved equipment list I purchased this Motorola Surfboard SB 6141.Though it arrived from the seller in only two days, it took another five days to get it activated from Time Warner. I provided Time Warner with the MAC ID number and was told it would take one to three business days for the activation to happen. It seems the first not-much-customer-service rep didn't take all the information in it and it never got entered into the system. The second Time Warner rep also wanted the serial number along with the MAC ID number. So after another three days of waiting Time Warner finally got around to activating the modem.Though I've had no issues with it, two different speed test websites seem to show its download times are slower than the el-cheapo Ubee modem provided by Time Warner. The Ubee modem had download times in the 20 mps range, while this one is closer to 10. The upload speed is about the same, and just short of 1. I still have to get back to Time Warner on this issue, however I get the feeling they're going to tell me, "You bought, it you own it, there is nothing we can do about it." I'll update if anything changes.Bottom line:This is a decent modem if you have Time Warner cable. It activates properly once Time Warner gets around to it. As for speed, YMMV. A word of caution: the supply of these modem seems to vary and the price with them. I purchased mine for $99, so it'll pay for itself in just under two years. Keep in mind as the price goes up so does your payback period.Update 1/4/2013:Now that I've had this for a while I'm happy to report there absolutely no issues with this modem. Since my initial review speed tests indicate the download speed has returned to what I had with the old modem, normally between 25 and 30 MIPS. Now that the prices have come back down to a more reasonable level, it's an even better choice than paying rent on a Time Warner modem..

This is NOT meant as a consumer product but that does not mean it can't be used as one.

Get the white version of this item which is for consumer use and can be updated by you. Price is exactly the same.

The older model was freezing up more and more frequently, needing a full power-down reset (that included disconnecting not only the power supply, but the CATV coax as well, there's a bit of power that comes through the coax that keeps the internal capacitors alive). That was an annoyance, so much so that I actually installed power and coax switches so that I could do the reset quickly and easily. But then I went ahead and bit the bullet, deciding to buy the DOCSIS 3.0 version. This modem also comes in a while plastic case for $10 more, but I opted for the black not because of the price, but because I can look at it from my desk (against another wall) and see the status lights against the black plastic: I don't think i could discern the status lights against white. While the actual internet speed is governed by my ISP (the older modem actually performed very well), the new DOCSIS 3.0 has eight download and 4 upload channels to share, as opposed to the DOCSIS 2.0 with one each, so reliability is improved. I have not yet had to reset the new modem, and since I expect to have it for more than a year, it will have paid for itself based on what my ISP charges to rent one. I use Cox as my ISP, this model is also apparently accepted by Time Warner and Comcast, so it is usable in most service territories should I move. The case size is about the same height and depth as the SB5100 it replaced, it is just a tad thicker overall, but considering the base attached to the old model, the new one occupies almost the exact same footprint. Be advised, some images of this model show both an RJ14 and USB jack in the back, mine came only with an RJ14 (ethernet).Update 5/1/2013: This device is still going strong with no problems since mid February. My experience so far with this modem has been very good, and fortunately not similar to those that report receiving a defective or used model. To the contrary, mine arrived in a sealed package, all documentation included, inner sealed bags and tape intact, and with a full strip of 5 MAC/serial# labels in addition to the one on the bottom of the device itself. The protective peel-off was intact on the face of the modem, there were no scratches front or back to indicate it had ever been used. It was in the institutional packaging, which is what I expected. As I mentioned above, I explicitly chose black in order to be able to see the indicator lights from a modest distance, I did not think I could discern them against the white faceplate. My firmware was up-to-date, and did not require a firmware download. My modem was sold by 'On The House', and fulfilled by Amazon. My ISP is Cox (San Diego), so I have been fortunate not to have had the issues with Time-Warner, Comcast or Charter reported by others. I do suspect the DOCSIS 3 modems, with multiple bonding channels at higher frequencies, are perhaps more sensitive to cable signal strength that my older DOCSIS 2; I did have to swap some line splitters on my RG59 cable (newer RG6 is better) with taps and replace some cable ends in order to get the signal dB off the low edge of the preferred range +10/-10. I can sympathize with folks who received bad ones, perhaps a check of the seller's ratings might be helpful. I think I'd buy this modem from On The House again. As yet I have no reason to anticipate failure of this modem..

You will need to have the Serial Number and MAC address available when you speak with them.  You should contact your local TW office and not the national support Help Desk (at least that is the case in Maine).

It's for your own sake. I bought mine before reading it. So far I've been lucky, but two weeks is too short a time to be certain, and your experience could be largely different. Additionally, my review also includes context referring to permutations's review.As of this review, I've owned my OEM 6141 modem for about two weeks. It's been running well and stably after a Comcast technician came.On my modem's Help page (to access yours, go to 192.168.100.1), copyright is from 2000-2011, so the modem is likely manufactured sometime in 2011. However, it doesn't necessarily mean my modem had ever been used.After some Google search, I believe it is true that you wouldn't be able to buy black version of 6141 from large retailers. On the other hand though, it is quite common for small online retailers to sell new OEM items. How they are able to acquire modems that are supposedly sold to and only distributed by ISPs, I don't know, but to claim all black modems are used is not exactly fair, either. Anyhow, "buying OEMs" itself runs the risk of not having extended warranty and having higher risk to frauds in the first place, with the benefits of lower prices. It is a trade-off and risk any OEM buyer has to take. In short, do it at your own risk. Caveat emptor.Oh, my modem does have the latest firmware (version 1.0.6.10) and Firmware Build Time: Oct 29 2012 18:07:13. Since my ISP is Comcast, I couldn't tell whether my modem was used or Comcast has updated its firmware. I believe it is likely the later, since Comcast technician asked for the modem's box, which has modem's spec info -mac address, serial number, etc- on it, and did something with it in his tech van for a long while when visiting my house.Now more about the tech visit.The reason I scheduled an appointment is because my connection was behaving badly. I don't know if its behavior fitted the definition of modem flapping, but the connection was disconnecting and reconnecting for at least 2 to 3 times per hour and having frequent ping spikes (webpages would suddenly had long halts and then resume loading), and the downstream speed was way below what my service claims but the upstream speed was always good. To be more precise, one of my three downstream channels had higher noise (31~32 SNR ratio) compared with the other two.The reason I heavily question whether it was flapping or not is because the above connection issues only happened half of the day, always between roughly 9pm to 9am. For the other half of the days, I was able to get advertised speed and had stable connection. Due to this peculiar behavior, I asked for a tech visit - after two useless Comcast online chat assistance, however.And, yes, after the tech took out a filter, which I had no idea what it was for, attached to the cable running to my house in the green cable box on the street curb, the peculiar issue has stopped since then. Now I have eight downstream channels with very good signals compared to 2+1bad I previously had.So, I might had been lucky not to read permutation's review prior to calling the tech. Otherwise I might had returned my OEM 6141 and still be stuck with the connection issue even now (*Whatever the tech did with my modem box didn't solve the issue). In short, my point is, if any connection issue happens with using this modem model, don't hastily assume your modem is bad right away. It might not be the culprit. Trouble shooting your connection carefully.Because, frankly, used &#8800; bad; OEM &#8800; bad. My previous modem 6121 was used for more than 5 years without any issue. Motorola has been a trustworthy brand. Being OEMs doesn't change that -- only abusive usage would.-------Update-------Below is from modem's status page:Current Time and Date, Jul 01 2013 21:55:35System Up Time: 13 days 13h:26m:6sIt's been up and running without any disconnection or slowdown for nearly two weeks.------Recommended Troubleshooting Steps------1. If it is already known that your ISP provider does not update customer-owned, non-leased modem firmware. Avoid this modem.2. If you have connection problem using this modem, first check the modem's firmware version. If "Firmware Name" on 192.168.100.1's "Help" page is older than SB_KOMODO-1.0.6.10-SCM00-NOSH. Contact your ISP to request a firmware update before deciding to return modem.3. If the firmware version is 1.0.6.10 or newer and the connection issue persists, request a tech visit to check cable routing problem.- In my case, a filter inside Comcast's cable collection box on street curb was affecting connection signals.- The removed filter started to affect my connection only until I upgraded my service from Performance (25Mbps/5Mbps) to Blast (50Mbps/10Mbps). At first I thought my connection was unstable due to the older modem incapable of handling 50Mbps downstream. Which, of course, turned out not to be the case.4. If both 2 and 3 fail to fix connection issue and you did not have issue using prior modem(s), it is likely the modem is faulty. Return for refund or exchange..

Be sure to pick a modem that is supported (recommended) by your internet provider.

I chose the Motorola based on the experience I had with the slower model (SB5101) provided by Time Warner.A fair number of web sites limit the data transfer rate from the source, so even having a high speed modem may not increase the user's down load speeds.

Particularly annoying when streaming SC2 videos on Youtube in 1080p.As soon as I got the SB6141 setup I was instantly pleased. It has the exact same design and footprint as the SB6121, just faster and better! I've been running it for a couple weeks now with no issues at all. Even with the same Comcast internet package as before I am getting consistent speedtest.net numbers around 28-34Mbps! 1080p streaming is smooth over both wired and wireless ethernet (am using a Netgera R6300 for wireless).If you need to upgrade your modem, this is an easy win over the older SB6121. However, if you don't have issues with your 6121 there's no huge reason to upgrade unless you want to spend the cash.

Originally, I used an Apple TV as my go to streaming device but now that I have the Roku I rarely find myself going back. I just recently realized that you can send pictures and music to your Roku device using the native app. A feature that I always enjoyed on the Apple TV. I find myself using the Roku for not only Netflix but also Plex. Plex was only on the Apple TV if you were jailbroken and is supported on the Roku out of the box. I use it to stream my media from a server out the house and it's been great.The only downside I could maybe see with the Roku is it's lack of a native YouTube channel. I hear that is an alternative on the Roku however for any die-hard YouTube users, they may be disappointed to find out that Roku lacks it.

My first Roku is still running on my living room tv, this HD model is being used in our bedroom.  Roku is a great product with a massive library of &#34;apps&#34; that allow you a variety of content.  If you have Amazon Prime, this is a great little toy.  If you have a Netflix or Hulu Plus account, this is a must have for your &#34;dumb&#34; tv.  If you have HBO GO then this is an absolute no brainer.  The content selections are just fantastic.As for the quality of the physical product, it is solid.  The box itself is small and unobtrusive - so much so that you'll barely notice it next to your tv.  The remote requires a direct line of site with the Roku itself but if you have a smartphone you can just use the Roku app to control the box via wifi and hide the little bugger out of view.  As many reviewers have mentioned, the Roku itself is very light and I can see it easily breaking if it is slammed on the floor accidentally.  I've dropped it from approximately 3 feet and it was fine but drop it from anything higher and it could easily crack or break.  Just treat it with the same respect you would your cable box or dvd player and it will be fine.Yes this is &#34;only&#34; 720p but I have found the picture quality to be quite good (note: both of my tvs are 720p so I wouldn't benefit from the 1080p higher-end models anyway).  Wifi signal strength has been fine for me with router two rooms over from the Roku.As for the interface, it is pretty simple and straight forward.  In my opinion the interface is stale and dated and is in need of a refresh.  I imagine Roku is already working on this along with the new models they introduce over the next year or so.Combine Roku with an Amazon Prime and/or Netflix/Hulu Plus account and throw on an OTA antennae and you have yourself a cordcutter's dream.  I will be going cable-free in 2013 thanks to Roku and a couple indoor antennaes.  Goodbye $60/month cable bill!!.

By the way, the HD model is all you really need.  Don't pay 3 times more for the really expensive models.  Keep in mind that, to get full 1080 HD, you need a full 1080 HD signal.  Most Netflix programming is not 1080, so why bother.I have a couple of programs that let me watch youtube videos on my TV.  I can also pull up the full episodes on NBC.com and stream them to my TV.I have the Roku connected to a laptop in my office wirelessly via a program called PLEX.  It lets me play any music on that computer through my TV or entertainment system.I can also stream all those vacation/wedding/puppy pictures from my phone wirelessly to the TV with the Roku app.Lose the remote control?  Just use the phone app.Why is this better than the internet programs on your blueray player?  Good question!  Roku is constantly updating the software and adding new programming.  For instance, there is now a PBS app where I can watch all my favorite PBS shows for FREE.  Things are constantly improving.  Once someone writes some half-baked software for a blueray player, that software never changes. We even have a blueray player that we cannot use because it does not have Hulu.

I had bought the Netgear Wireless Router WNDR37AV, and then used this on the televisions.  My son who is a computer programer, suggested I get this one instead of the 1080 as it would not require as much signal to operate.  We have tried it on all three of our TV's and it works just great.  Very pleased with it.  We used it, HDMI on two, with the extra cord that I purchased.  On one, we tried it with the analog, the cord included.  I did not think it was as good, but still very good.  We still have the analog in our other home, so that this would work with those TV's as well as the HD TV's.  Installing it was not at all difficult, as it leads you through all the steps and it is very easy.  I will be 79 and if I can set it all up, no one else should find it challenging.  Very pleased.

I have it loaded with apps it runs with no problem, and have yet to find a good app it cannot run. If I let it sit and just use it to answer calls, texts, and email, with the occasional surf on the web, I get a whole day on one charge, and then some. If I get going on a game, or playing music steadily, a charge lasts me about 5 hours. The screen is plenty clear enough for me, and although I stuck in an old 32 gig card I had laying around, you could probably get by just fine for most tasks with the onboard 8 gigs, or maybe a 16 gig card would be ideal costwise. Wifi connections are strong, and it takes a beating from a toddler pretty good on occasion. I find the cameras adequate for my needs.The bad:This tablet has power problems. It thinks it is charging when it is not, and vice-versa. When hooked to my PC through the USB cord/AC adapter, it connects and disconnets itself randomly. Jiggling the cable sometimes has effect, sometimes doesn't. The problem is in the power connection, where you input the AC adapter plug into the tablet. This was found out after buying a separate cord.SummarySamsung customer support was my resort because my Amazon refund time has passed. I received a very nice email within hours of my email to them, asking me to send them the machine for service. Apparently this power problem is documented online in several places and Samsung is aware of the problem. Since my machine is running fine otherwise, and it is accepting a charge intermittently, I am going to keep it rather than send it in for repair, which could take some time. I think this could be a manufacturing defect.My suggestion would be to solve this problem which arises for too many devices of this type. Lots of work and ingenuity goes into the machine, but comparatively little into the powering of it. From laptops on, this has been a problem, and it seems to be getting worse with newer devices. The best machine isn't worth much if it can't get power, or register that power correctly..

It can read disk drives, or it can allow the tablet to act as a disc drive, when plugging the tablet into a computer.I bought my OTG adapter cable from NewEgg.  It's cheap and everything I plugged into it worked great.Remember to eject/unmount the OTG device via system Settings > Storage > Unmount OTG device before taking the cable off the tablet.About the tablet itself, I will not give a full review, but just a few things people might've overlooked:. The biggest advantage of using the Galaxy Tab vs other cheaper no-name brands is that apps are usually tested for it.  There are cheaper tablets out there, like the Asus Memo, but they have compatibility problems with many apps.. Even though the new Google Nexus 7 will blow this tablet away in terms of hardware specs, I still bought the Galaxy Tab 2 because availability of microSD port and because of reliability issues of the Nexus..

The downloading of books from Amazon worked amazingly fast too.  I know I'm green, but I'm sure I will have plenty of enjoyment with this device in the coming years.  That is, if my batteries hold up.  Outside of a boring and difficult to understand manual, I don't know why anyone would be disappointed with this instrument of elderly confusion.  It responds well to finger touch.  Almost too much.  And it doesn't seem to me that it lags with instructions to go from one request to another.  But then, I'm only green.

Downloaded several apps, copied a ton of music and tested playback from my microSD, watched multiple TV shows using Netflix and HBO GO and a movie from my own collection...flawless. Sound through headphones is really great. Video is very high quality in my opinion. I am a loyal Samsung customer, and this product lived up to my expectations.

Let me say I used to have all apple stuff, apple computer, iphone, ipad, etc. Over the last year my apples have rotted, went bad and needed to be replaced. Instead of paying high dollar for all new apple stuff I went back to a windows PC, an Andorid Galaxy S2 phone, still had the iPad but it was in need of replacement.So I got to Best Buy they didn't have these out yet but they pulled one out and let me play with it while they set up the are for the demo unit to go. I liked it, very snappy, great screen. The device comes preloaded with ICS on it, it's VERY snappy with zero lag so far.The screen while not a retina display like the iPad is still clear enough for me. After all I'm not holding this inches from my face. if you do you get a chance to play with 1 of these before you buy go to the movies app on the device and play the life demo to see how clear and crisp the display is.It quickly synced up with my Google account and I was already able to start downloading apps from the play store within minutes of getting it turned on.So far this device is excellent. It feels like it's built well, the back is not as fancy as the Galaxy S2 phone however I plan on getting a case for this so the back battery panel to me doesn't matter much.I'll update this later after I get more time to play with it, so far though for $250 this is a great deal. I also played with the Kindle Fire and the Blackberry playbook both which were available for $199, but I opted to spend the $50 more for the Samsung as I've been impressed with Samsung quality over the years. (Currently my TV's, blu ray players, computer monitor, phone and now tablet are all samsung brand. They make good products in my opinion.)--UPDATE 8 hours later--I used the GPS on this earlier and google navigation/maps to get me to the hardware store. Ok I didn't NEED it but I wanted to test it out. I found that you MUST have internet for google maps to give you directions, I had a hotspot in my car so I turned it on and navigation worked perfect. If you don't have wifi you can still use GPS, it does lock on fast however it can't query to get you directions. If you used an offline GPS program like navigon or something that would do the trick, but YES gps is accurate and fast.I also used the bluetooth on this to stream music from the Tab 2 to my car, quality was excellent.Apps and stuff, so far every app I have tried is compatible with the exception of one, and I can't remember what that one was so it was one I really didn't use much at all I guess. I have put a few games on to test it, so far so good and still no lag.Hows the keyboard? It comes with stock ICS keyboard and it works well, if you start typing fast there is a tiny lag between hearing the click of the feedback and seeing the character appear, however all letters make it without any vanishing. I am looking for another keyboard though as spelling isn't built in it appears... I am probably switching to Swiftkey or swype both which appear compatible with the device.Also, the IR Blaster = awesome! I was going to buy a $100 harmony remote for my entertainment system, well this Galaxy Tab 2 has an IR blaster built right in and the application for it is simple to configure. Less then 3 minutes I had it set to turn my TV on, control my bose sound system and also control my Tivo HD and Blu Ray player. Very slick!More to come, if you have questions on how this works please leave them in the comments and I'll do my best to answer them quickly. Also, if you find this review helpful please make sure to mark it as such!--UPDATE--Morning after, do I regret buying it? Nope, still a fantastic device and I'll tell you a few more things I found out.1. I use Dropbox on my home computer and put the app on this tablet. I also use a tivo at home and thought about how could I get my shows on my tivo to my computer then to my tablet? Well I use TivoToGo to transfer shows to my computer, then I place them in a drop box folder and they sync automatically to my dropbox account. I then on the tablet have an app (free and paid versions) called "Folder Sync" and I have that set to every hour check my drop box Tivo folder and download any latest tv shows my computer has copied. This means that in the morning when I leave for work my tablet has all my shows from the previous night I didn't get to watch on it so I can for instance watch one or two on my lunch break, without having to have a wifi connection at work!2. Need to make a phone call? Unfortunately this device doesn't have phone support. However Skype works great with both video calls and audio calls. You can pay for a phone number from skype (it's cheap if you wanted it) and actually treat this like a phone assuming you have wifi wherever you are. I did try google voice app, that will not allow you to make calls and use the tablet as a handset, it instead asks you what phone in your account it should call.---UPDATE 2/20/2013---I see a lot of activity on my review, big thanks to everyone that found it helpful and I love the activity. I wanted to provide an update. While I really liked Galaxy Tab 2, I did make the jump a few months back to the Google Nexus 7 and have to say that tablet has taken over as my primary device. The Galaxy Tab 2 and Nexus 7 ARE similar, however I really like the pure google/android experience that the Nexus provides. If you are on the fence, I would recommend going with the Google Nexus over the Galaxy Tab 2 at this point..

You have to use the Reader Hub to open ebooks if they are not Amazon books, it does not give you an option to open the ebooks on your ext sdcard. I have surfed the internet for 2 days and have come across posting that tells you it can not be done. I am not downing Samsung.

Once I upgraded to this tablet I found that they had removed the texting capability. My husband got this for me at Best Buy and they have a 15 day return window. In less than 15 days I started having the device freeze up so I took it to Best Buy and discussed my troubles with the Samsung guy. Turns out I was maxing out the ram even though I was constantly closing every application to make sure that nothing was running in the background. I returned this device (hooked the old device back to the Verizon account) and purchased a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. The Note 8.0 has more ram.

I've tried using a couple of other devices (Chromebook, iPad, etc.) before landing this device, and it blows the doors off all of them.  This thing is just plain FUN to use, and it does everything and more than I want it to do.  Being a heavy Google Apps user, and deep into cloud applications, the more I use it the more I find uses for it.  Some of the apps I have installed include Citrix Receiver for login to my most used cloud app (Thomson Reuters SaaS), A1 Keyboard Plus, Chrome to Phone, File Manager HD, Flipboard (very cool), GrooveIP, Kayak, NOAA weather, Open Table, Play Music, Sports Tracker, Spotify, Spotimote, Xfinity TV, Zinio.  Plus, lots and lots of games.  Out of the 5gb of included storage, I still have 3gb left.  Plus, I installed a 32gb microSD card, but I'm not sure yet when I'll need it.  My home screen shows me my Gmail account, Google Voice, Drive, and Calendar, plus six more of my most used apps.  The only app that doesn't want to work for me is the Peel remote control, but I'm working on getting that going, it would be great, if it worked.  With GrooveIP I can use it to make outgoing calls over wifi.  The 7" size makes it great to use while eating breakfast, or in bed or on the couch.  It even fits in my pocket.  Battery life is great, and the screen is more than enough for my needs.  At times, it will bog down a little, but I find restarting it fixes that issue.  The volume can be way louder than I need it to be.  Screen brightness is best left on manual, and it gets brighter than looking at the sun.  The five home screens hold a lot of icons, and I have one I haven't even started to fill yet.  The widgets are useful, as well.  I highly recommend this product, and the Amazon price and shipping are awesome.  For $250, it's the best deal out there.  I love my Tab 2 7.0, and I feel sorry for my old Android phone now.

I purchased this based on my satisfaction of other Samsung products and my liking of their original 10.1 tablet. I won't make this too lengthy and will get right to the point, starting with a list of pro's and con's.Pros-Expandable memory (up to 32gb)-Icecream sandwich OS (Soon to be outdated, see below)-IR Port-Front and rear camera-Good WiFi receptionCons-My biggest issue with this tablet was the screen and I noticed this on all units I have been able to take a look at. The color calibration on this is EXTREMELY below Samsung standards. This was the worst screen I have ever witnessed on a Samsung product. When compared to the Kindle Fire and other tablets in this tier,the biggest thing I noted was the galaxy tab's whites are more of a cream and have a dirty look. It's possible this may be corrected in an update in the future but as for now, how did this ever make it to the consumer market?!?!-Icecream Sandwich will soon be outdated by Jellybean. I have had 4 other Samsung Android devices and they are notoriously slow getting Android updates out. Feel free to look this up if you don't believe me, it's a fact.-Also because it is Samsung, you do not get the full Android experience but instead you will get it mixed with their Touchwiz software. I have found this to have a very negative impact on the performance of this tablet and more often than not, just gets in the way.-The iconic Icecream Sandwich face unlock feature that was so advertised with the OS release? You won't find that it on this tablet because Samsung doesn't support it.-The IR port does not have a paired Samsung application to run it. Instead you will be directed to install the Peel Reel app to make use of it. It is one of extremely few apps that can make it work. Peel Reel is somewhat buggy and requires an internet connection to use (you can see it's reviews in the Google Play Store, will improve over time I am sure). I found that it works well on Sony and Dynex televisions, but for some reason it just couldn't master an LG flat screen. Something for Peel Reel to work on, but why no Samsung App to support this?!?!-I put the cameras in PRO because they are included unlike some other tablets, but their quality limits their usefulness. You will be able to video chat, but be prepared to look pixelated.-I mentioned performance before, but I wanted to throw in about requiring restarts too. I thought we had moved away from the tech limitation of having to restart a device to clear tasks, RAM, etc. but apparently not. When you turn on the tab you may be able to play a graphic intense game or an equivalent on this tab, but later in your session, you will see some lag times on it without a restart. Samsung includes it's own task manager but it does not clear up the lag with extended use.-The touch sensitivity needs to be stronger and their is no option to increase this, expect a few double taps along the way.At the time of this tablets release this is the most superior 7inch tablet and easily kills the Kindle Fire in performance. However based on the issues stated above, I recently sold my Galaxy Tab 2 7in. and pre-ordered the upcoming Galaxy Nexus 7. I will not go into it's specs on this review, but I would encourage everyone looking to get into the 7inch tablet field to give a look at the Nexus 7 or wait on the next generation of the Kindle Fire. The Galaxy Tab 2 7in. just isn't worth it..

I know what you're thinking..."WHAT? The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 has expandable memory.  Use that."  Well, while you would be correct that the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 offers external memory, you can NOT move apps to it.  Additionally, movies purchased on the Play Moves & TV app cannot be moved to the SD card. I'm seriously considering returning this tablet.UPDATE:After one hour deciding what to do I ultimately decided to return this tablet.  I bought it to entertain my kids with movies and apps while on a 20 hour trip to Greece.  After downloading two games and two movies (NEITHER OF WHICH CAN BE MOVED TO THE SD CARD) the memory was COMPLETELY full.  This makes it useless for my purposes. I am hopeful that Amazon will not charge me a restocking fee because as far as I'm concerned advertising the 32GB external memory is misleading since it's basically useless. The only thing you can put on it is pictures and videos you take (without rooting it, that is, which I am NOT about to do since it would invalidate the warranty).  I am returning this and am instead purchasing a second Google Nexus 7.  For just $30 more I can get 32GB internal memory without the added expense of purchasing an sd card (as I had to do with the Samsung)..

I thought it was going to be laggy and suck but i found that it responds quite fast. Yeah some things dont work as it should but. Its not a computer its a tablet and the youtube application sucks in this tablet and sucks on ios. it even sucks on pc but hey. thats cuz they keep adding removing bloking stuff etc and what not. so its google's fault. I have been using it mostly for chat and listenting to music (flac and other lossless formats) playing some games and browsing (although not as much as i still prefer the desktop browser experience)Been playing a game called StrikeFleet Omega. Pretty good i recommend it. Though i would prefer to play it on a bigger screen. Another one that is pretty good is called TowerDefense thumbs up for those two games. One that was a let down was plants vs zombies. I decided to try the filtered apk before buying it to prevent it wouldnt work on ICS and it didnt. So i didnt buy it after all. Realized there are tons of complaints about the game not working on Ice Cream Sandwich. But hey what do you expect from the guys at EA. Which are the ones publishing the games for popcap.About the tablet. Nice audio output. I have been using PowerAmp the paid edition and it works great. Sounds nice and i have a portable DAP i use from nuforce to improve the audio experience. Video plays great as well although i rather watch movies on a big screen.It sounds ok when the audio is being played by the speakers. One thing i hated is that there is almost zero accesories for this thing. It has a really good screen. and i would recommend for whoever wants to buy this to use swiftkey keyboard instead of the samsung one. only thing good about the samsung keyboard is that it has a TAB key on it.Why is it the iPad killer for me? well for once its not as heavy as the iPad. It handles well on video calls thru skype or tang, yeah it doesnt have tons of apps. but then again i dont really like the ios closed environment whole thing. and that u have to be married with itunes.Im thinking of selling this one and getting the nexus 7 with jelly bean.Will update this review as i get more around it..

It really does change how you use an iPad.  It now feels like a notebook computer with a touchscreen!  The design is excellent - thin and light.  The only issue I have is with the price.  It couldn't have cost them more than US$15-20 to make this so why is it priced at US$100?  I bought it and so did many others because the marginal utility we get from this wonderful product is more than $100 but in the tech business, most products are sold nearer to marginal cost than marginal utility because of the brutal and global competition.  It would be interesting to see how long Logitech can enjoy such supernormal profits before someone else comes up with a similar product at half the price.  But kudos to them for coming up with an excellent device, beautifully designed and timed well to market.The other question that bugs me:  Why didn't Apple come up with such a product itself?  It could have easily bundled this with new iPads and sold millions of them.  Just a fraction less sharp than they used to be without Jobs?30 JuneI've used this product for about a week now.  Now I know why notebook sales are falling off a cliff.  The world was waiting for a well designed ipad keyboard that was easy to carry around and Logitech has provided it.A few additional comments after more extensive usage.  First, I have such a strong tendency to hit'alt tab'to shift to the next application (like with a PC) which obviously doesn't do anything.  Any software fix by Apple to allow that will ease the transition of computer users to this ipad / keyboard combination significantly.  Second, the idle standby time of the ipad drops quite meaningfully as bluetooth is on all the time.  This is not a big issue as the standby time for the iPad was excellent to begin with.  But worth noting nonetheless.  Finally, I was surprised how good this thing is as a Stand.  It is so stable thanks to the magnetic fit and yet simple to remove when necessary.  I read a lot on my ipad and used to hold it up with both hands in bed.  Now, I leave it in the keyboard and find it a lot less tiring.  I also find myself watching more movies on it now..

I added it to my Amazon wish list, and voila, a nice person got it for me!First, the keyboard itself is fantastic and I have no troubles typing fast, legible text. The keyboard is chiclet style, similar to Apple's own keyboards. For what it's worth, I am a tall man with big hands, and I am able to type very, very fast on this compact keyboard.Second, the upright stand effectively turns your iPad into a full blown laptop replacement. The slot that holds your iPad is well designed, and my iPad is securely held in place.Third, the keyboard has nifty shortcuts (Function - 6 for Cut, that kind of thing) which is really nice. There's a home button on the keyboard. I wish there were more shortcuts!Finally, when used as a case the iPad is ensonced in aluminium, offering robust protection. The magnet on the hinge is strong enough to hold the iPad even when dangling, although it could be stronger.Bottom line is this is a very high quality product that will meet the needs of most. It's also a wonderful gift for anyone who owns an iPad 2.I have been using it in my office in NYC and have received near constant "oohs" and "ahhs" about it..

I had purchased the Apple bluetooth keyboard for my original iPad but stopped using it after some time due to having to carry it around separately. I recently purchased the 4th generation iPad and saw this keyboard thanks to a banner ad from Amazon. I decided to give it a try.First, the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. Very easy to type and great feedback. The best feature of the keyboard has to be that it doubles as a smart case so no more carrying around a &#34;separate&#34; keyboard. It protects your iPad and attaches very nicely to it. Simply open this keyboard cover on the iPad and it slides nicely into the middle of the keyboard. It displays the iPad at a great angle for reading and fits pretty securely into the slot. The slot also seems to have a magnetic connection to it to hold the iPad more securely as well.Connecting the keyboard via bluetooth is of course very simple. It also has an on/off switch which is nice for battery preservation. It's also a better switch than what Apple's had where I couldn't easily tell if the keyboard was on/off.The keyboard charges with a standard (yes standard) USB mini connection. The cable that comes with the keyboard only hooks up to a USB port on say a computer and not a wall adapter but that was ok for me. The cable is also VERY short. But that was ok for me because I have simply been using a different USB mini power cable that plugs into the wall that I use to charge my bluetooth headset for my phone. One less charger to carry around. Also, so far the keyboard seems to hold a charge for a LONG time. I haven't run out of battery yet nor even seen the low battery indicator the keyboard claims to have. I've gone 7 days without charging and it's been fine. Now during that time I wasn't using it all day but still...I HIGHLY recommend this keyboard. The feel of the keyboard is awesome, the fact that it connects so well to iPad as a Smartcase makes it like you aren't even carrying a keyboard, and it adds protection to your iPad screen..

I did find the keyboard lacking as case in general and missing some key features I was looking for that I would expect for a $100 keyboard. Although this item is not advertised as a case but as cover for the iPad. I would have liked it to protect the back of my iPad and or allow me to use my own case with it. I use the black leather smart cover in combination with the Macally protective case on my iPad 4. There wasnt enough space to use either of my cases with this cover. Also the short cut buttons have to be pressed with the function key in order to work. The keys on the keyboard were also cramped in my opinion I would have preferred them to be more spaced out.

The keyboard also attaches magnetically on top of the Smart Cover allowing the screen to be protected and not move when in transit in my bag.

It snaps onto the iPad closes to form a nice hard shell (with the exposed back of the ipad forming one side, and the chrome colored backside of the keybard forming the other.  Now for the cool bit...The keyboard attaches to the iPad using the smart cover magnetic strip.  When you open the keyboard/iPad case you're left with a keybard connected to the iPad; both can be laid flat on a table, but this would be pretty piontless.  So the keyboard has a slot that's designed to hold the iPad.  Placed in the slot the iPad leans back at an angle just steep enough to be perfect for watching, playing, etc.; a hardcore artist or editor may with for something a little more flexiblle.  The only problem is that you iPad is really unprotected outside of its keyboard ecosystem, right?  Wrong.The keyboard attaches to the iPad like a smart cover.  If you pick one carefully enough, you can find cases designed to work with smart covers that will work perfectly with the keyboard cover; they don't just work perfectly together, they enhance each other.  Let me explain...By combining theZeroChroma Vario-SC Case/Stand for iPad 2, 3rd/4th Gen (Black)case with the Logitech keyboard you can create one slick looking, ultraflexible, well protected cover case setup.  Benefits:- Provides dual sided protection with the zero-chroma's back covering the iPads backside, and the keyboard cover enclosing the front.- Remember that the only ways to prop the iPad with the keyboard cover were to place it into the slot either portrait or landscape orientation?  Well now the ipad can be propped up in any number of positions without even disconnecting it from the keyboard.  Of course you can detach it and stand vertically or horizontally on its own, or place it into the slot* provide the keyboard for a more compact solution.* Note that placing the zero-chroma enclosed iPad into keyboard's iPad slot is the only thing that could be consider "imperfect" about this combination, but it's quite nice too.  The slot was cut to fit the iPad edge very snugly, and doesn't really allow for much beyond the iPad.  Used with the Zero-Chroma cover it was difficult to fix the iPad into the slot, whereas the iCircle's cover tended to have it's edges pulled off by the groove.  But the solution is ridiculously simple: use the zero-chroma stand to prop the iPad so the groove just pins it, rather than holding it up.  That works perfectly..

I have several Apple products at home, but it's not indiscriminately my first choice when buying electronics. In fact, when I made the decision to buy a tablet I bought an ASUS Transformer because I liked the keyboard option.  Unfortunately it was kind of junky for how much it cost, so I returned it and bought an ipad.  I kept the box and the receipt because I wasn't sure how much I was going to use it, but I ended up using it all day long every day!  I'm a college student, and it's so nice to have all of my textbooks, my day planner, and my class notes all in one small device.  The only thing that would make it even better was a keyboard that I could type quickly on, and without any of the lag you sometimes get from bluetooth devices.  I tried the Zagg one, and it was very nice other than the fact that it's REALLY hard to get the ipad out of it.  I worried that I was going to break my tablet trying to pull it out of that case.  If you don't mind just leaving it in there though, the Zagg case offers a lot of protection and works pretty well.  So I returned that too and resigned myself to using the on-screen keyboard and just dealing with it...until I found the Logitech Ultrathin.  Again, I told myself that this thing had better really WOW me for how much I paid for it and it really has!  I use it in class to take notes (I have an app that lets me record lecture and type my notes, and it syncs them!) and now I'm able to do word processing, chat with friends, and send longer emails more efficiently.  The keyboard isn't mushy and doesn't flex in the middle, but it is on the smaller side so it took some practice to get used to it.  The magnet holds it in place very well (there's an audible 'click' when you set it in the tray) and the smart cover magnet works great as well.I'm sure anyone who's looking into purchasing this cover realizes that it leaves the back of your ipad pretty vulnerable.  Fortunately, BestSkinsEver makes a very thin, clear plastic skin that protects the back of the ipad from getting scratched or scuffed, and it's very reasonably priced.  It works perfectly with this keyboard, and they even make a matching skin for the keyboard!All in all I'd say that this is the best purchase I've made for my ipad, and I've tested a LOT of different accessories.  It looks great, works exactly as it should, and so many people have stopped to ask me about it that it's hard to study in the library anymore!  Money well spent, for sure.I should add that I did not buy mine on Amazon, because I was able to find it at my favorite warehouse store for a bit cheaper....

It's mostly all good, with a couple of minor negatives.The good:-Attractive compliment to the Ipad.  Take away the Logitech logo, and you might think this was designed by Apple. The front cover is the same color and finish as the back of the Ipad, which is nice.  It is slim, and not bulky like the Clamcase.-Super easy to set up.  Literally place your Ipad in the grooves, rotate it a few degrees until the magnets catch (with an audible clicking sound), activate the bluetooth (the first time only), then you're good to go.-Ipad is VERY secure in landscape mode.  The magnets are strong and sturdy.  The Ipad is not going anywhere.-Unlike many other reviewers, I had absolutely no issue with the magnets used to connect the cover to the Ipad when it not being used.  This was my biggest worry, but it is an absolute non factor for me.  Maybe Logitech corrected an earlier design flaw, or maybe the magnets will weaken over time.  Who knows.  I can only tell you that the cover stays closed and secure for me.  I even tried to make the cover and the Ipad slide apart and I couldn't (without a **tremendous** amount of effort).-Keyboard is obviously not a full size keyboard, but I found it very easy to type on.  Good tactile feel, and dead on accuracy.  It takes a slight bit of getting used to, again because it is not a full size keyboard, but nothing that will bother you.-Special function keys unique to the Ipad are nice-Very quick and easy to remove the case if you want to use the Ipad by itself.-Supposedly you get 6 months of battery life per charge.  Pretty amazing.The negatives:-This is not a case that offers any kind of real protection.  The back of the Ipad is totally exposed, and in the event of a drop, I can't see this offering very much protection to the front either.  Just know that going in.  There are other cases that are bulkier and less attractive, but that offer greater protection.  I didn't buy this cover for the protection, so I am ok with it. I may eventually get a protective sleeve for travel (anybody have any good recommendations?).-Black piano finish is a fingerprint magnet.-Not really an option to use your Ipad in portrait mode with this case.  You can do it, but it not very secure because the magnets are designed to hold the Ipad in landscape mode. Not a big deal for me, but just be aware.-Pricey @ $99, but in my opinion, worth it.Overall, even with the few negatives, I am giving this a 4 star rating.  I like it, and as long as it holds up, I am a happy camper.  If I run into any durability issues, I will post updates.**Update 8/9/12** Bought the Targus Hughes Leather Portfolio for Ipad (available here on Amazon) and it is the perfect companion to the Logitech case. With the Logitech case on, my Ipad fits securely and attractively inside the Targus portfolio.  I will really only use the extra protection when I (or my kids) are using the Ipad away from home, but it's nice to have when I need it.  For those of you who are worried about scratching the back of your Ipad, or about the Logitech case failing to securely close (which has not been a problem at all for me), or just looking for some extra protection, then I highly recommend the Targus case..

The keyboard is great for writing emails when I am on the go. I also think the size of the keys are arthritis friendly.  The viewing angle of the keyboard is pleasing to the eye.

The keyboard when attached to the ipad, is always detaching itself from the ipad.  The magnets are very weak.  Also, I can't  tell if my caps lock are on.  There is no indicator light on the Ultrathin.  I returned the Logitech and went with the Zaggkeys Proplus.  It was well worth the extra $30.00.  The Zaggkeys Proplus' magnet is so much stronger than the Logitech Ultrathin.  The Zaggkeys Proplus and ipad stays together even in my handbag.  There is also back lighting on the keyboard in seven different colors.  The caps lock key lights when it is activated.

It puts the iPad to sleep when you lock it up and it also adds little weight. Best part about it is that you charge in VIA USB! So there are no exta batteries.

The first one was a Kensington. The Kensington works well and has a nice feel. It's only problem is that it is a "Portfolio Type" and is too bulky for my tastes. The second was a Boxwave at a moderate price. What a nightmare! Dont buy it. Keep saving until you can afford this one. I thought at first $100 was a bit steep for a keyboard, but then I bought the best iPad 3 that is available, why not keep trying til I get the keyboard I want. This is it.  It has a great feel and works great. I can sit it on my lap and type just as fast as if I were typing on my PC keyboard. The magnetic latch that holds the keyboard in the slot for upright use is strong enough to lift the iPad and keyboard all at once just by lifting the ipad. The magnetic latch that holds the iPad and the keyboard together for storage also works like a charm. I love this keyboard. The only thing that I could find at all wrong with this keyboard is the Micro USB charging cable. When they say micro they not only mean the type of cable, but the length as well.  It can't be more that 18" in length. Luckily I have one that is 4' in length and a couple of 6' length ones ordered. Other than that this keyboard is just shear pleasure. At the $100 price, you expect Quality and that is just what you get! This is MY KEYBOARD!!This keyboard is very easy to sync. Turn it on. Go to settings on iPad, ensure bluetooth is turned on, wait a few second until you see "Logitech Ultrathin KB Cover" in Devices and tap on it, In a few seconds it will say connected and you are ready to go! It stays synced too and when you turn the keyboard off, and then turn it on again for use it is just there!L OVE THIS KEYBOARD !!!!  Buy it and you will make yourself proud!.

First, the hinge completely fell apart after one month of SUPER DELICATE use by an adult. It didn't break it just fell completely apart. I have all the pieces in a ziplock bag on my desk for when I get time to glue it all back together. Second, the rubber stopper that holds the ipad in place is now coming unglued as well and pushing up out of the base. I don't know how far this stripping will push up out of the base and what reliability my ipad will have in staying in place once it falls out. I'm just really upset this is happening all in one month after such delicate use. I can't imagine what it would do under normal wear and tear. Doesn't Logitech test these things?? I'm even more disappointed b/c this is not mine, it's my employers and they are a non profit and I feel like I wasted their money suggesting they buy this thing for my work station (after they said they would oder me a zaggfolio) only to have it break in 30 days ((eye roll)). I would avoid this thing like the plague if you need any durability at all and I would NOT buy this for a child or teenager to use...it would probably last a day..

Traded up from the previous design, which was good to have, but frankly it was a pain to extract the iPad from the keyboard case, so I found myself not picking my iPad as often when it was in the case. The KB cover is a whole different game. I use my iPad as often as I feel like now, though I do sometimes still have to find someplace to stash the cover when I'm not going to need it.Basically I recommend this keyboard to everyone who asks me about an external option. The BT is rock solid, the built-in magnets are smart, and the keys feel great. I can usually type more or less full speed. The only suggestion I'd make to Logitech is to switch the fn keys for volume to track skipping. It's easy to change the volume buttons on the iPad, they're right on top when the iPad is in landscape mode! But to skip tracks you have to leave whatever you're doing, which is kinda silly. Also, move those fn keys to the left more so that I can quickly reach the keys with one hand. That's seriously all I feel I need to make this thing perfect..

That's true -- it does look very nice with the ipad and it's incredibly light and cracker thin. However, I'm struggling a little with the keyboard being small for typing. I'm a woman and I cannot imagine a man with large hands handling this well for daily work purposes or anything that requires regular writing of any volume. It's fine for internet stuff, quick emails etc. but it would not be a substitute for a laptop or desktop for school purposes or any other situation where you may have a lot of typing to do Aside from that I have absolutely no complaints and I LOVE the way it clicks together.

Good tactile feedback for the touch-typist though ill-suited for handheld or even laptop use.

The exterior matches that of the iPad and looks very sharp.  The unit syncs very easily.  When you put the iPod into the slot on the keyboard it Clicks so you know it is in correctly.A couple of things I am not thrilled about is the magnet that holds the keyboard to the case should be stronger.  Like others that have mentioned, the keyboard is not likely to stay attached in a briefcase or bag.  Logitech needs to improve on this.  Secondly, in the slot that holds the iPad there are 2 'rubber' like strips that are to help hold the iPad in place.  The strip on the side pulls out of the slot and leaves the glue from the strip on the iPad.  I emailed Logitech and they said I had a defective unit.  I got a second unit and had the same issue.  Eventully the strip came out and I cleaned off the glue from the slot and no longer have glue on the iPad.

You are using directly against the surface you're typing on.3) Cover doesn't stay closed because there is no magnetic strength whatsoever to do so.

The functionality is just absolutely perfect, typing is smooth and natural (after the initial "full sized to tablet size" adjustment, but that's with any of them).I was worried about the back of the iPad lacking protection, so I bought the Belkin clear backing case.  I returned it.  There are magnets in the "stand" portion (the white strip where the iPad sits), and the case hindered the ability of the magnets to connect.  They were much more looser, and you lose the ability to grab the iPad when it's connected (in the white stand strip) and hold it like normal.  The keyboard would hold for a bit, then promptly fall flat due to the weakened magnet connection.So my solution was a slipcase.  I bought the Targus A7 one, but there's about an inch of free space where the iPad can shift around, and it's more case than necessary.  It's a nice case and fits it, but I've ordered the Targus Crave slip (smaller, made specifically for the iPad) - in hopes it fits both keyboard and iPad more compactly.As mentioned above one of the nice features are the magnets in the dock strip.  You can use the keyboard as a stand (with bluetooth off), and pick the iPad up by it's edges and type via touch screen - the keyboard stays connected, unless you twist it back and disconnect the magnets.  Connecting it like a smart cover is as easily as moving the iPad over the magnets - they latch, you can let the iPad close shut, and it turns itself off/on.  It's a smooth motion and quick once you get the feel for it.When you "unclam" the iPad from the Keyboard (when the smart magnets are connected), there's a bit of a learning curve on getting a feel of what angle will disconnect it, where you should grab it to maintain control over it, etc etc.  The first few times I did it, I either opened it too much, twisted it, or pulled too strongly - which sent the keyboard falling straight to the ground.You eventually get a feel for it, and learn where to hold onto it so that doesn't happen.Cons are the plasticky internal construction, the plasticky "smart" magnets, and to a lesser extent (if you care) the finger print factor (it's very high).  A built in stylus slot would be absolutely perfect as well (good luck drawing a diagram or chemical equation with the keyboard..).The pros greatly outweigh the cons, and owning it and putting it through tons of use the past week, has only increased those feelings.  Very highly recommended.THE keyboard to get..

Luckily, my mom got a brand new iPad for Christmas this year so she donated her old one to me for free. I was considering flipping it for cash until I used one of these keyboards with it and realized the amazing potential of the pair. In fact, I like this pairing so much that I sold my 2012 MacBook Air (for more than I paid) and am now using the iPad + Logitech Keyboard for college schoolwork. With all of the cloud services and apps available, it plays super nice with my iMac at home, so nothing is missed from the macbook.Battery life is excellent, keyboard shortcuts are extremely useful, and the magnetic cover function is a huge plus for portability. The keyboard itself is pretty standard in size when compared to Apple's own offerings, however the backspace/delete key is rather small and takes some getting used to at first. It would be cool if you could adjust the angle of the iPad in its dock, but hey you can't have it all.Anyway, if somebody was considering getting rid of their iPad because of a lack of productivity, I would immediately point them towards this keyboard. It really changes the way I use my iPad and makes me feel less silly for owning such an expensive toy. As for some apps I would recommend to download for their cloud functionality--Byword, iA Writer, or Pages, depending on your preferences, are all great choices for typing up papers or whatever else. I can start up a paper on my iMac, then pull out my iPad + keyboard when I have downtime on campus to rattle out a few paragraphs.Just buy it. I don't know how you could be disappointed..

I previously tried ZaggFolio, Belkin keyboard/folio, and older version of Logitec keyboard case. Zagg was too heavy and it was tough to wrestle the ipad out when I didn't need/want the keyboard. Belkin keyboard was GREAT (by far my favorite to type on), but the folio was clumsy and kind of ugly. I gave the older Logitec keyboard case to a relative (in part to justify ordering the new ultra-thin for myself).I loved this at first, but like it less and less over time.Pros:* thin,* light,* portable,* looks like part of the iPad when closed* Smart-magnet does workCons:* Not backlit (but none of them are. Are they?)* Awkward in portrait position - because magnet only helps in landscape position. I am using portrait (or alternating more frequently) more more than anticipated, thus, this has become more of a problem over time.* Intermittent(and unpredictable) multi-keying. This is a known issue with Logitec/Zagg keyboards, and happened with both of the ones I used before the Ultra thin.* No longer holds a charge. I was NEVER able to go weeks without a charge, and I now need to charge every other day or so to ensure that I can get through the day. Also, with no charge-status indicator, there is no way to anticipate when it will quit. I wind up charging daily just because I don't want to run out of juice.* Unstable when closed: other reviewers have shared same: it doesn't always stay closed inside a bag - this is manageable with use of a sleeve, but kind of a pain* The rubber strip DOES come out and IS very gooey. It's a mess to clean up* The white groove gets grimy despite fastidious cleaning. Once grimy, it is hard to return to clean white (not unrelated to goo - see above).* Piano black does show finger prints - again, the goo makes this far worse once the strip works its way out of the groove.* Rubber corner-cushions were gone within days if not hours - thus keys do leave marks on the screen.* I called Logitec to describe the multi-keying problem. The first rep said he would put me on hold for transfer to warranty dept for a replacement. 20 min later, a heavily-accented tech wanted me to go through troubleshooting - which was not what was told would happen. As they hope we will, I stopped pursuing it: too much of a pain. Maybe with alternative in hand, I will resurrect the question.I really thought the Ultra-thin would be the Only. Keyboard. I. Ever. Would. Need. Not so. I just ordered the Targus Versavu for several reasons:* Easy rotation between portrait and landscape* Better protection - if not best, still better* Hoping to eliminate the multi-key problem* No gooI will likely use both depending on priority (stability vs. weight; reliable charge vs. questionable) on any given day. That would feel better if the UltraThin was priced a bit lower - two $50 options are more appealing than one $99 and one $50. I really thought the UltraThin was worth the price. At first.

I got the original, and now have a 3rd gen one as well. Over time, I use my iPad more and more, and my laptop less and less. Most of the time, I find the iPad on-screen keyboard satisfactory. But if I am writing something of any length, including this review, I find it slows me down considerably. For example, no matter how hard I try to adjust, I keep hitting the &#34;n&#34; or &#34;m&#34; keys on the on-screen keyboard when I am going for the spacebar. This keyboard completely solves that problem, and in combination with eliminating several other &#34;annoyances&#34; of the on-screen keyboard, it has greatly increased my typing speed on the iPad.Do I have any complaints? Not really. At first, the keys seemed a little small and cramped. But I got used to that, and, in fact, I think I might be able to touch-type faster on this keyboard than I can on my full-size laptop because of the closer keys, and the thinness of the key platform.The title of the review says &#34;better than expected&#34;. One thing is that there are arrow keys that work well in apps where I enter text. Maybe it was just ignorance on my part, but I thought I had read some reviews of earlier iPad keyboards that said you had to lift your fingers off the keyboard to position the cursor in text you were editing.Another plus is that the various function keys that Logitech has added to the keyboard are well-marked, and fairly useful. The function keys for marking text to cut or copy could be a little better, but they work fairly well, and in fact, I think Logitech has improved these on the newer iPad Mini keyboard cover by moving them to the arrow keys. I wish they had done that on this model.One disappointment had been that many of the special keys, like &#34;option&#34; or &#34;cmd&#34; don't seem to work with the iPad. When I first opened the package and looked at the keyboard, I was surprised that these were present, and hoped that they would implement a bunch of shortcuts on the iPad like they do on a Mac. Now I realize that they are probably there to allow the user to use this keyboard as a bluetooth keyboard for a Mac, although I'm not sure why you would want to, except in a pinch.As for physical aspects of the keyboard. Design and build quality are top-notch. That does not surprise me. I have generally been very pleased with Logitech products in the past. When used as a cover, this keyboard an the iPad make a very attractive package. Looks a little bit like an 11&#34; MacBook Air. I like the fact that this keyboard attaches like the Apple Smartcover. That means it is easy to detach and set aside. I prefer to use my iPad without a cover for the most part.Also, the slot that holds the iPad when using the keyboard seems very secure in landscape mode, and for me, the angle at which the iPad sits is close to ideal. As some others have said, the slot works fairly well in portrait mode as well, but so far, I have been using it almost exclusively in landscape mode..

They work wonderfully and I have had absolutely no problems with either. These SanDisk memory cards are 64 GB microSDXC class 10, UHS-1 cards, which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30MB/sec.The UHS class 1 designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real-time full HD video recording. Of course, this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds, but most modern devices that offer full HD recording, such as camcorders, digital SLR cameras, and cell phones with built in Full HD recording do support this standard. The benefit of using a UHS-1 card on a UHS certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough.However, because these are extra high capacity, sdXC cards, you will need to make sure that your device can support microSDXC cards, and not simply microSD or microSDHC ones. The biggest difference is that the microSDXC standard uses the exFAT file system, rather than the FAT32 or NTFS systems.

My last one was about 5 or 6 years old and had a reputation for staying online for nearly a year solid before needing to be rebooted.  Lately though, I've had to reboot the D-Link about once a day or so so it was time to look for a new one.  In fact, I would be inclined to stick with them, but I was looking for an AC band router and found scant information in reviews on D-Link.If you've been reading reviews on Routers you'll know that the vast majority of them have almost as many one star as five star.  While some of the lower ratings I think come from user confusion or lack of understanding of how it works or should be configured, others have a legitimate defect or problem with their unit.  While I am not an industry expert on routers or networking, I am proficient with setting up and maintaining a work group with a mix of 3 PC, 2 Virtual machine PC, 1 Mac, 6 Android OS phones and tablets, a TV, X-Box, Wii, iPod Touch, Kindle, 2 network printers, shared printer, and 2 NAS (Network Attached Storage) drives so I have a lot of diverse traffic on this router.Pros:Lightning fast wired and wireless - my MacBook on N-Wireless going through two walls, 70' outdoors and through another wall gets the same speedtest numbers as the wired PC in the same office building outside of my house in the back yard.Easy to setup - the only issues I had were not related to the router itself but I had configured my NAS devices and a printer with static IP's (on the device itself) so they couldn't connect to the new router until I changed it to Auto on the devices.  If you use DHCP reservation on the router and Auto IP on the computer or device then you wont have that problem.User interface - not too bad.  I think mostly it was just getting used to the difference from my D-Link.  I was able to easily figure out how to setup several port forwarding options (although the QOS settings weren't all that intuitive for what I wanted to do).Wall mountable - this is a big plus for me because of the location of the router in my garage.  I wanted it up high on the wall and easy to get to.Three large antennas - When it comes to antennas bigger is better for signal strength and range (assuming it's tuned to the right length and all that) and this router has larger antennas than others.  In the detailed AC Router shootout article I read on Tom's Hardware .com this router stood out on all of the features and needs that I was looking for and overall as well.Reliable - I have not had to reboot this router once since I installed it.  All wireless devices are consistently able to connect and stay connected 100% of the time.Port/Application forwarding - worked as expected on the first try.Load handling -  I've got FSX, TeamViewer, TeamSpeak, GoToMeeting, customer's RDPs, Skype, Google Drive, DropBox, live video streaming on PC, Mac, TV, and all manner of stuff running and syncing all the time here and all work flawlessly without setup (except for FSX which needed custom port range).Cons:Uh....  hmmm... I've got nothing.Summary:Solid, fast, reliable router that lives up to my high expectations.  If you don't have port forwarding or devices with static IP's setup on your old router you'll probably just be able to plug this thing in and go.  Even if you have a more complicated setup like I do it's still easy if you have the aptitude.  I would highly recommend this router..

Given I've been in tech for many years, I should have started with a firmware update. Do the firmware update first. I can't emphasize that enough. It'll go much easier on you if you do.I was pleased I could do all the setup wirelessly. However, it locks solid sometimes requiring a power cycle during setting changes. You have to do a couple basic settings before you are able to update the firmware - I find that annoying. It's intended to be helpful and guide you through setup, but that isn't what a person always wants.I exchanged the unit because my first one was utterly unreliable in spite of fresh firmware. It kept dropping signal and taking a bit to reestablish again. I'm also annoyed with how much the thing has to reboot. I'd like to make all my changes then apply them in one reboot - but with this unit you have to apply and reboot for every single little thing. Grrrrr.The second unit seems better on 2.4GHz, but I can't connect to 5GHz. The first router let me connect to 5GHz, but it was dreadfully slow from a few feet away. I don't really need the 5GHz, so turned it off for the time being. The next few days will tell if it stays stable on 2.4GHz...I like the VPN feature, and port forwarding was a breeze to setup for ssh and my synology unit.The product has promise, but isn't reliable yet. Get this if you want bleeding edge and don't mind having to tinker a lot or wait several months for it to be fully capable. If you need something solid, look elsewhere - this isn't there yet.The jury is still out on whether I return mine for something else or not.**EDIT 11/27**Second router is also unstable. Gave up and disabled 5GHz, and the 2.4 still doesn't work reliably. iDevices frequently time out waiting for a connection or report that they can't join the network.

I bought the ASUS RT-AC66U about a month or two ago, upgraded the firmware, and installed it. It has worked flawlessly ever since and I have not had to reboot or babysit it at all. I haven't used all the functionality yet (e.g. usb attached drive or printer), but everything else has been better than the Linksys alternative - even the configuration interface, which is very intuitive and easy to use. I am very satisfied with my purchase!!!Update: If you're a semi-techie and have performed router firmware updates in the past, you will appreciate this. For years, with the Linksys units I owned, I would have to re-enter all of my configuration settings after updating the firmware. It was a ROYAL PAIN! Whenever something went wrong, Linksys/Cisco would say "Use the reset button on your router, re-enter all of your settings manually and see if that fixes it...". Ridiculous. Anyway, I did my first live firmware upgrade today on the RT-AC66U after running problem-free for a month. I upgraded from the 164 version to 188. The upgrade took no more than 3 minutes and the unit RETAINED ALL OF MY PREVIOUS SETTINGS without issue. This, in and of itself, was worth the switch to ASUS. Easy, reliable, and non-aggravating....

I have a greatly increased coverage area with much higher throughputs throughout my property.Bedroom above the router was at 5Mbps, now at 32Mbps, kitchen was less than 5, now at 26.  Coverage extends to the garage and back of the yard when I had no coverage at all.  One bedroom was the bermuda triangle, a deadspot so bad that even my extender outside the bedroom didn't help, now my wife can use her computer there and watch Netflix on the wireless media player while on her eliptical.  No need for powerline ethernet now!The web interface is well thought out and very intuitive.  The only issue I had was that UPNP did not automatically open up my ports for my Go-Flex Network Attached Storage so that I can access it away from home.  Rather than using a cloud service I stream my my music and movies from my Go-Flex while away from home.Router also serves as a DLNA and Itunes server and has several additional features such as cloud, USB sharing and remote downloads.  I'm not using any of these, and if you are using a network attached storage device you cannot utilize with these services which seems like an oversight, only USB attached storage can serve as your Itunes storage.I like the ability to set time restrictions on my daughters devices so that she's not using them after bedtime.You can use a 3G/4G USB dongle as a backup if you lose your service provider, or if 4G is what you use primarily; I haven't tried this and am not sure of any extra costs or if you can use with a sharing plan.  Either way, it's sure to pull a lot of data down on your 4G plan which can be pricey.Has QOS (Quality of Service) but you need to be familiar with it as well as what and how to configure.I LOVE being able to adjust the power settings for both bands individually, this really helped provide better coverage.The unit is good looking and comes with a stand meant to stand it vertically.  I used mine backwards to provide it with a sloped profile, providing air underneath for cooling but keeping the profile low and the antennas where I wanted them.What I would improve:The ability to give MAC IDs nicknames, in several areas, such as setting static IP Addresses you can only view the MAC address. I keep two windows open when setting these so I can refer to the device name if it's displaying one or the current IP address.I would allow the same connectivity as USB devices to Network Attached Devices such as hard drives to give them the same utility.Wifi attached printers should have the same utility as a USB attache printer, this would simplify setup for some wifi printer users.  (some would say that this may be a bit superfluous but not everyone is tech savvy and getting these kind of devices set up can be a pain).UPNP should automatically configure port forwarding for other UPNP devices that need it (I had to add open and point the ports myself).QOS should be much simpler to set up, with the ASUS it's basically up to you to figure out what you need and how to configure it.  Some simple questions such as "Are you a heavy internet gamer?", "Do you watch a lot of YouTube, Netflix, Hulu or other online video?", "Do you use VOIP, Skype, etc.?" and from these make the appropriate configuration; it's really not THAT hard.There are three additional Guest Networks for either band, each is highly configurable and can be time restricted for usage and access to your intranet.VPN server creates a private network to your home network from anywhere in the world at anytime.Firewall with URL, keyword and service restrictions.Various usage, system logs and network tools.IPV6 and Dual WAN ready.Have not found any user configurable settings for usage alerts or throttling based on usage (cap limits).Power user friendly, tons of advanced settings if you know what you are doing.Bottom Line:This router rocks, in terms of simplicity and just working I am VERY satisfied and would not hesitate to buy another.  Easy and intuitive interface, strong coverage, high throughput.  I would recommend this as a great router for home and especially for a small business.I love ASUS products and have never been let down by one yet..

He then moved the router to the top of his desktop (which has a fan blowing out the top) and has not had any problems since ( that was three weeks ago).  I don't know if heat issues are the cause of everyone's problems with this router, but it does appear to be a factor for at least some.

The provided 2-Wire Gateway is 802.11g standard, which was causing us some issues with range, the number of devices on the network and microwave interference.  To give a quick overview - we have a  desktop, 3 laptops, iPad, Surface, 2 iPhones, 2 Kindles and 2 Apple TVs that are on the wireless network.  We were running into issues with wi-fi reception in several parts of our house - particularly the Master Bedroom (for Apple TV) and the family room (additional Apple TV).  Streaming to the Apple TVs worked, but there we often had long buffering delays and trying to use airplay was often problematic.  I purchased and Asus router to put behind the AT&T; 2 Wire Gateway and am incredibly impressed with the increased performance.Many people measure the improvement in their performance by the throughput they measure at various locations.  I was lazy and used the Speed Test website to measure the speed obtained by a laptop in various locations before and after the switch to the Router.I have a 22 Mbps internet speed when using the hardwired connection to the 2 Wire Gateway.  Our family room is 30 feet away and there are 4 walls separating the wireless router and the Apple TV.  With the 2 Wire Gateway, we were able to achieve about 6Mbps internet speeds - which is the lower threshold for streaming Netflix (especially in HD).  When connected to the Asus Router - we now achieve speeds of 12Mbps (twice the 2 Wire speed).  Moreover, since the Asus operates on 2.4 and 5 Ghz frequencies, we don't have as much microwave oven interference.  We recorded similar results for the master bedroom.  This has resulted in significantly shorter buffering times when streaming videos, much faster downloads onto devices and faster web browsing.Setting up the router was pretty easy - the 2 Wire does have some options to sense when a router has been connected to the Gateway and can help configure easily.I tried a D-Link router prior to the Asus Router and the performance of the D-Link router was actually worse than the 2 Wire Gateway, so Asus has a significantly better product.I highly recommend this product for solid home networing..

I initially upgraded to the newest factory firmware but found &#34;Merlin's&#34; firmware that appeared to be superior to factory.  I think this router has been out long enough now that the firmware bugs are worked out.  So far so good in that regard.Another issue I initially had was the range wasn't very good and wireless data was slow from a short distance; worse than my old Linksys WRT54G and a cheap refurbed Netgear E2500/N600 router with no external antenna's.  Range was the whole point why I upgraded from a $35 router to a $120 router with nearly a 5 star rating.  After some more forum research I switched the band from 20/40 hz to 20 hz.  I also increased the power output from a value of 80 to 100.After doing all this it is now FINALLY a superior router to both of my previous ones.

Set up the user accounts and a subdirectory in each.Then I tried JUST the 0.726TB partition and attempted to copy a 4GB total subdirectory from another computer on the network (through the Win7 box) to the attached 4TB drive.  Before it got done it complained that it could not copy a file when the directory did not exist.  I looked and sure enough - the directory - which I had seen it already copy some files into, was no empty and would not allow copying to it.I dismounted the drive properly - took it to a Win8 machine and plugged it in and did a check disk - it claimed that directory was corrupted.  I asked it to fix it and then re-scanned and it said all as ok.Put it back on the ASUS, tried operation again.  Repeat of issue.This is similar to the issue I had with the WRT160NL except as I recall it did not fail until I had copied a whole lot more than 4GB.I then re-scanned and fixed the drive and took it to a Linux Desktop running MythTV/Xbuntu.  Did the SAME operation of copying the 4GB of files and it was quite happy.I don't know why these Router folks cannot get this write since they are using a Linux core. And Linux seems to handle NTFS quite fine - I have been using it with Ubuntu for years now.Salient facts this time:  Seagate 4TB External STBV4000100 with USB 3.0.ASUS Router with current firmware: 3.0.0.4.374_979-gbc8961eSet to use NTFS with compression, account security.And one more thing - the Router Tools disk scan does not see a problem - except it says something about a non-standard "0x1000 byte sector size" but then says "that is ok". This is ALWAYS the message I get when I use the Tools Scan, whether there is a problem or not.Non standard sector size 0x1000 bytesGetMount: "/dev/sda2"GetMount: Device is not mountedNTFS quick check: seems to be consistentchkntfs returns 0UPDATE: 1/17/2014:I continued my testing because I was trying to figure out what the root issue was.I found that if I turned OFF NTFS compression ON THE PARTITION or when formatting the partition, that the errors do not seem to occur.I have now copied, erased, and moved more than 600GB without any issue.ALSO, when the compression is turned off the Router Tools disk scan does not return the strange message above.So although there is a switch in the interface to support compression "NTFS Sparse Files support", it seems to not work.This seems to solve or partially solve the use of it via SAMBA (Windows) file shares.But the DLNA server (an implementation of MiniDLNA under the covers) has some issues also.In particular the video or jpeg files it "sees" seems very erratic and less than half of what is on the drive.In researching on Internet with the group mentioned below, they say the problem is NTFS and that changing to EXT3 formatting of the USB drive will solve the problem. I am in the process of converting the drive and re-copying the TB or so of data and then retesting. So we will see.There is also something flakey with the 5GHz band.  I setup both access points with different names so I could connect to either and I saw all three initially (GUEST also) but then the 5GHz one disappeared.  Rebooting the router did not seem to make it come back. Curiousy though, my wife's Samsung Galaxy III phone sees it - but it seems to be unreliable and/or limited considerably in distance compared to the 2.4GHz band.That having been said, this looks to be a GREAT product for those willing to hack into the Linux OS on it. There is an entire group (ASUSWRT-MERLIN) that maintains a replacement firmware for it - and they seem to have solved at least some of the problems.  But that is an area to go ONLY if you are comfortable with the Linux OS or have a friend that can do it for you. I have been telnetting in a looking around at logs and setups and it looks pretty interesting.So I changed my rating from 1 star to 3.  Because if the stated features do not work out of the box, there is no way I can give it higher than 3..

However, even with the Gorilla Glass, it is still vulnerable to damage, especially when dropped face down (see drop test of Nexus 7 on youtube). Now enter the Tech Armor Matte Protector. What's good about the matte is it gives it a glare free surface. It is a trade off between form and function. I will take function. It does alter the form which is very subjective. Personally, I like it better because it creates a more robust appearance.HOW TOUGH is the MATTE Protector?It lasted a long time, before I had to replace it. The first one (1 of 3) lasted 4 months, but then I got a small deep scratch so I tried replacing it. Unfortunately, my second screen protector (2 of 3) application was a failure, so I used my final screen protector (3 of 3). It lasted for a while, until I dropped it, FACE DOWN, on a rocky surface, without any protective case. It did destroy the Tech Armor screen protector, with a lot of dents and scratches, and even small pokes from the rocks. However, there's absolutely NO damage to the NEXUS 7's screen. The screen protector took all the beating. Impressive.This is undoubtedly a 4-star rating product, until....I read that Tech Armor replaces the product if for some reason you fail to apply it properly (as in my case on my second screen), or simply from normal wear and tear. I sent them an email, and then - boom - a replacement is all the way.For the price of this thing, they even do replacements? This product is a winner.VERDICT: I highly recommend this product.Claims on the anti-finger-print. While it repels fingerprints, it doesn't do justice with smudges. I've had a matte protector back in the days of Windows Mobile and that did not smudge as much as this one. Still, free replacement on a product that actually works and does what it's suppose to deserves 5 stars..

I mean, the numbers on the tabs require a frigging magnifying glass to read!!! Hence, I put it in reverse order - er, not good! The second attempt resulted in bubble-mania! Third one bent up in the process, and would not align properly. The fourth one [FINALLY] blends in so nicely, that you cannot tell it is even on the iPad. But that took a LOT of practice...read on!Referring to the aforementioned, my major complaint that I have with the screen protectors is that the instructions are not idiot-proof, and therefore they are missing a major segment of the market to sell it to. Yeah, you know who you are out there, you just won't admit it! :&lt;)So, in the spirit of curtailing, and maybe even eliminating any frustration out there for my fellow idiots, a few valuable pointers that may save you time, and more important $$$$$$$$$$:1. Bubbles can be your friend! - No, I am not kidding here. It depends on how you use them. When you see those &*^%$# bubbles milling about when you embarking on squeezing them all out, migrate the big bubbles to the smaller ones, en route to the edge. Seriously! The small ones will be swallowed up by the bigger ones, making your life much easier.2. Wash your hands with alcohol prior to installing. After you do this, wash your hands with alcohol and let them dry, prior to installing. Followed by, washing your hands with alcohol, prior to installing.Get the message? :&lt;)3. Unless you are installing this in an Apple assembly plant, free of any and all dust particles, yes, you will get dust, and dust creates bubbles. You will use that sticky tape they provide you, and then admire the shiny, clean finish. And SOMEHOW between the time you do that and actually start peeling the screen protector, applying it, the little dust gnomes of the world unite and say "Heh heh heh, attack!" This part will drive you insane!!!The way I defeated these cretins was simple: Adhere the protector starting at oneedge and as you work your way down, blow, blow, blow your horn! Be sure notto spit as you go, or you are hosed. It will work out nicely then for you.4. The `squeegie' they provide you is lame and wimpy. Use a credit card, with the end covered in the provided dust cloth.I understand though, why they did this: Too much downward pressure and yourun the risk of damaging your iPad's glass. So, take EXTRA care when doingthis part.5. And MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL: Because us idiots like to think that we know what we are doing, by all means, READ THE NUMBERS ON THE REMOVE STRIPS! Ironic that they put in big block letters to remove these after use [as if, duh, you would really think you would leave them on - even an idiot like myself knows better], and yet, the numbers are written smaller than an ant's rump! Go figure.I hope the above proves helpful. Again, I burned through/wasted money on a total 2 pack to get to this point. As for the product itself, it looks nice, although I WISH that the manufacturers would give tips on how to clean the fingerprint streaks from it that occur after some use. It draws streaks like a magnet, and the cloth does little to help.I would think Windex, but am afraid to damage said screen. Any advice here?!?Good luck!UPDATE: 5/9/2013 - Tech Armor came through and sent me a replacement on their dime. Now that it is seated correctly, I can say that I have had it for a couple of weeks now, and it stays on nicely and seamlessly, unlike the overpriced, nasty-feeling ZAGG cover. Now, if only I knew a great way to get rid of those fingerprints! :&lt;) THANK YOU!!!.

I'm not a fingerprint person. I hate to have fingerprints on a computer screen, so for me this tool works great. I love it for when I'm reading or playing a game of solitaire. For choosing off a menu or when you can specifically hit something without "fat-fingering" with your stylus it's a great utensil. Where it can get difficult to use is when I'm wanting to scroll across my menu screen, then I end up choosing something I didn't want and my finger is a better applicator. You can't use the edge of the stylus, you need to press point on and sometimes press harder than I like, but it gets the job done.Overall, I give the product a thumbs up. It doesn't completely replace the need for using my fingers, but in cases where I want to use more of a pen feature, it works great...typing is excellent with the stylus!

So while these pens work great on both my Kindle Fire HD and my smart phone, I've found that I don't really need one.I used them for a few days when I first received them; it was fun and novel. I placed one inside the pocket of my purse, and the other in a bed-side drawer, then forgot about them for a month or more.If you have especially shaky hands or extra large fingers, these would be a great tool to use with a tablet or smart-phone.

However, after 6 months, it has lost its elasticity and become rigid. It no longer smoothly glides and has become less responsive. I am constantly finding when gliding the stylus on the screen that it is somehow initiating the pinch zoom feature. This is very fustrating especially when reading a pdf or web page on the internet. It is the stylus because it does not happen with my finger or a less expensive stylus I recently picked up at a swap meet. I will not buy another of these because I do not see the value of having to buy two to last a year. I am  happy with my 3 pack I bought for $2 at the swap meet and will see how long these last.**Updat e-June 12, 2013**I emailed Marware customer support and within hours I got a response informing me that this pen has a one year warranty.

They differ from traditional laptops in a few important ways:<br /><br /><strong>Chromebooks run Web-based apps, not traditional PC applications.</strong><br />Chromebooks are designed to be connected to the Internet. You can create documents and spreadsheets or edit photos on a Chromebook using Google apps designed for these purposes. The Chrome operating system will not load and run traditional PC software like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop. However, files created in these applications can be viewed and edited using Google apps on your Chromebook or cloud-based applications like Microsoft's Office web apps.<br /><br /><strong>You store your files in the Cloud, not on the machine.</strong><br />To help make them thin and light, Chromebooks are built without large-capacity drives. So instead of storing your documents, videos, and photos on your computer, you save them to Google Drive (Google's Cloud-based storage service). Your files are password-protected and secure, and you can access them anywhere there's an Internet connection. If you know you'll want access to a file or photo offline, however, you can easily save it to the built-in solid-state drive.<br /><br /> <hr noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" style=\"clear: left;\" /> <h4>The New Samsung Chromebook<br /></h4> For Everyone. The Samsung Chromebook is a new computer that helps you get everyday things done faster and easier. It starts in seconds, has virus protection built-in, and runs your favorite Google apps plus thousands more. The Chromebook comes with leading Google products, like Search, Gmail, YouTube and Hangouts, so you can work, play, and do whatever you want, right out of the box. Chromebooks are a unique class of mobile computing devices designed for Web-based tasks. They run the Google Chrome OS, perfect browsing the Web, sending and receiving e-mail, and video chatting with friends and family. <br /><br />You can easily share it with multiple people- switching accounts takes seconds, and everyone gets their own files, apps and settings. And it's simple to use. There's no setup, and your files are automatically backed up in the cloud. At just 2.4 pounds, 0.7 inches thin, and with over 6.5 hours of battery life, the Samsung Chromebook can go anywhere you go. It's built to stay cool, so it doesn't need a fan and runs silently. It also includes 100GB of free Google Drive storage (for 2 years), a built-in webcam, and dual band Wi-Fi to make it easy to connect to wireless networks.<br /><br /> <hr noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" style=\"clear: left;\" /> <div style=\"width: 1027px; float: left; padding-bottom: 5px;\"><br /> <div style=\"width: 185px; float: left; margin-right: 20px;\">", "<img height=\"107\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/samsung/samsung-12q2-chromebook-icon-about-sm.jpg\" width=\"153\" />", "The new, faster computer that keeps getting better and better.", "<img height=\"107\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/samsung/samsung-12q2-chromebook-icon-seconds-sm.jpg\" width=\"155\" />", "Boots up in 10 seconds, resumes instantly and loads web pages blazingly fast.", "<img height=\"107\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/samsung/samsung-12q2-chromebook-icon-apps-sm.jpg\" width=\"155\" />", "Built-in apps and thousands more from the Chrome Web Store.", "<img height=\"107\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/samsung/samsung-12q2-chromebook-icon-hassle-sm.jpg\" width=\"152\" />", "Multiple layers of security <br /> so you don&rsquo;t need to install anti-virus software.", "<img height=\"107\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/samsung/samsung-12q2-chromebook-icon-cloud-sm.jpg\" width=\"102\" />", "Save your stuff safely in the cloud and never lose another file or photo.", "Chromebooks are designed to use Internet apps to access software that lives primarily on the Web rather than inside the computer itself.

I'm loath to give up my investment in knowledge to move to the cloud, while trading away some powerful tools and/or shortcuts.Things like installing new apps from the GooglePlay store, which have old devices from years ago, that I no longer own, yet make it difficult for me to simply add this Chromebook as a new device, have me rethinking this.Just because something is inexpensive, doesn't mean it's not costing me in other ways. Namely in that learning curve.  The offline availability is also an issue, and lag times on a crowded internet connection, like starbucks, is also another concern.When I boot my computer up, it has to WORK.  No (or few) excuses.With that said, this is great as a small, compact device for doing light writing or creating lists.I really like the voice search feature, built into it when searching on Google.Overall, for design, integration, and usability, I'd prefer an iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard.I'm going to stick with it, and bump up my studying on the OS and will update my review in a month or two, but early look has me feeling like:  "knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing".ADDITIONAL UPDATE 8/26/2013:When closing the Chrome Browser, if you re-open the browser, your tabs don't come back. Make sure you just minimize the browser.File that one under "Google everything you need to know about Google"andThe power cord charger for this thing is not "Standardized" in any way.

The only time the big rig gets fired up is for storing family photos/videos, for record keeping, and for heavy MS Office stuff. I can boot my Chromebook up, check my emails, and power down in the same time it takes for our desktop to fully boot/login (the Chromebook boots in around 5 seconds). This is a brilliant product that recognizes the need for a simple commodity-level device that "just works". It fills the niche that our iPad was supposed to fill, but just could not without a "real" keyboard. It still comes out from time to time, but for practical every day use, it just can't match up. The bang for the buck we're getting from the Chromebook is astounding.My only knock on it is I've had some issues with video playback, but it's been a rare problem. No issues with Youtube at all.

This major price-shift in the chromebook line took it from (IMHO) overpriced, to competitively priced. Because of the new price-point, you can think about this as a budget friendly laptop (if you use mostly web apps) or tablet replacement. Especially if you're someone who does a lot of typing and isn't a fan of doing it on tablet screens!I don't use it much myself, but I've talked with the recipient extensively, and this is a summary of their thoughts. They're a professional video editor who uses this as a supplemental portable computer when traveling, or just around the house where the have wi-fi and don't want to be chained to a serious editing station computer.Form: This is a compact, sexy looking laptop. Although it's plastic, it's well built, slim, and finished to look like brushed aluminum. Very nice. Notably, the keyboard is a full sized for normal human hands. I sort of expected it to feel cramped, but it feels normal sized and eminently usable.Specs: Screen is 1366-by-768 (16:9) so while you won't be able to view full 1080p video, 720 video looks great though. Dual Core processor w/ 2gb ram made web browsing with numerous tabs open quite snappy. Performance does drop off a bit if you're one of those crazy people who has to have 20 or 30 or 40+ tabs open at the same time. Camera is unequivocally made for things like skype, not for taking high-def pictures, but it suits its purpose just fine. For ports, you've got one each of USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and HDMI, so you can connect a mouse if you want or link it up to your TV for streaming HD video! There is a card reader for SD/SDHC/SDXC and audio has a mic input and headphone output. Local storage is somewhat compact at 16gb, but this is compensated by google drive access (100gb free for two years!) and can be supplemented by dropbox, amazon cloud, skydrive, etc.Web Apps: The giftee already lived extensively in the google web-app environment so they jumped right in! When I purchased it, this came with two years of 100gb google drive storage. Pretty cool. Otherwise web apps and such work just the way you expect them to work.Overall: If you want a super portable and very stylish laptop, you're comfortable working in the google environment of web apps, you have ready access to wi-fi, and you're on a budget so you don't want to shell out ~$1000 for a mac air, this is a fantastic product.Negatives:1) You really need to have wi-fi access to use this most effectively. Evaluate your wi-fi accessibility carefully before you take the plunge, and note that your local storage is limited to 16gb. Without that extra 100gb of google drive, or access to your dropbox/amazon cloud/skydrive you can easily feel the constrained.2) There is no support for netflix. Presently, every chromebook EXCEPT for this one (Samsung, ARM based) can stream netflix. Hulu and Amazon streaming both work fine but this is a pretty glaring negative for folks who are thinking about a chromebook for its portability and access to web apps.EDIT:The Samsung Chromebook now supports netflix streaming. I'll leave the original review for posterity, but negative #2 is effectively removed. I don't think it bumps this chromebook up to a 5th star, as negative #1 still stands, but it's a very nice improvement, and I'm very glad that google/samsung kept their commitment to netflix support!.

I read alot of the reviews on here good an bad and must say I don't understand the bad ones at all.  It is a great size, very lightweight, great cam/mic, and the full size keyboard is a real plus.  The fact that you don't need an antivirus program and you don't need to worry about running out of power (it has a six and a half hour battery life) is another big plus in my book.  I like the google chrome software and honestly have no complaints about it.  I have a tablet but it's limited since you need a keyboard to really do alot of things on the internet.  This netbook fits the bill. So if you are thinking about getting a netbook but not sure if you'll like this one........you will.....don't worry..

It charges quickly, and holds a battery for an impressive amount of time.  I give the Chromebook three stars for a lot of reasons.  The brightness of the screen is what ultimately ruined the experience for me.  While I'm sure the dulled brightness serves a purpose in regards to battery and the overall price of the product, it is simply an aspect that I could not overcome.  The trackpad is a multi-touch, useful touchpad.. when it works.  I noticed that my interactions with it were choppy, and I got somewhat frustrated.  Once I had the general knack of the Chromebook down, the trackpad had issues keeping up with my swift movements.  Overall, this is a great laptop for first-time computer owners, younger children, or college students who are looking for a computer they can toss into their bag and go.  However, it is not a product that I could see myself using as a sole computer.  The dim screen prevented me from being able to type a paper without getting a headache.  The way a product presents information (aka, screen) and how the user interacts with it (trackpad) are two of the most vital aspects of a product such as this; in my opinion anyway..

I'm using it even more often than I thought I would.  I have a high end desktop with a linux OS, a Dell laptop with Win7, a Nexus 7 and this Chromebook.  So far, the Chromebook is getting the most use.  The form factor, long battery life, full-fledged browser, and instant on make this device more compelling than the others.  I had considered buying a MacBook Air to use as a "couch computer" but this one does the job for a quarter of the price.  Note that I didn't say it does everything the Air does, because it doesn't, but it does all the things I was going to do with the Air.I think it's better to compare this Chromebook to mobile devices rather than to a full-fledged laptop, even though I'm using it more like a laptop.  That opinion may change over time as more HTML5 capabilities are utilized on the net, but even as a mobile device, this beats every tablet out there.  It has a nice keyboard, a very nice trackpad, full-fledged applications (I'm so sick of truncated browsers and email apps on Android and IOS), and a large screen that's much better than I expected, given some of the feedback I've read.One other plus - the 100GB of space on Google Drive for two years is worth almost half the asking price of this little machine.The only downside I see to this is the limited capability of web apps.  Like I said before, that may change, but until then, I don't think I could live with this being my only computer.  I need vector and bitmap drawing programs, sound editing, desktop publishing, etc.  These are robust apps and while they do have web based counterparts, that functionality is limited by bandwidth and feature sets.Over all, I'm VERY happy with my new Chromebook, and I'm looking forward to the changes that will be coming for Chrome OS in the future..

She, has loved using it, so this year I did a little research, and decided to order the arm based Samsung Chromebook for myself. It has been a joy to use, and must be one of the best values of 2012. Completely silent, cool running, and fast enough to do the job. For $250 it can&#8217;t be beat. Some have written that it is just a browser, and not useful, but they are flat out wrong. I use it everyday for all kinds of tasks, and find it very useful. It is not perfect, but it is very good, and will only get better with the automatic updates. As a bonus It also comes with 12 gogo passes to use on airlines that offer this service. I used it last week on a flight from Atlanta to Buffalo, and it worked great the whole way. I really like it a lot. As I said, though, it is not perfect. Here are a few of the things I like and dislike so far:Pros...-Silent (No spinning hard drive, no cooling fan)-10 second boot from off, 2 second resume from sleep-No anti-virus needed- Automatic OS updates-Plays Amazon instant video ( but not in HD)-Able to edit word documents offline-Read and create email offline (If you set it up)Cons...-File management still needs to be more flexible (no way to create folders in the sidebar)-No Netflix support for the arm version-Finish scratches easily-Right wrist-rest creaks at times.-Cannot edit spreadsheets offline (as of 1/17/2013)I'm sure I haven't explored all the features yet, but so far so good..

In theory this is a great machine, inexpensive, slim and light, with decent battery life, but since it can now be operated only guest mode it is effectively useless and unreliable.Aside from its addled brain, the Chromebook is hard to use; for example, there are a couple of keys missing (like delete) that makes word-processing and document production a major chore. With 2G of RAM it is noticeably slower than any computer with 4G of RAM. The screen is nice and the keyboard, aside from a couple of missing or relocated keys, is good.This would have been a great surfing and light-use machine, fantastic for travel and easily carried to meetings or to different rooms around the house--too bad it went loco.

It boots in about 10 seconds, and is completely quiet. It has two usb ports. One is usb 2.0 the other 3.0. The 3.0 port will also allow you to plug in an ethernet adapter if you don't want to use or don't have wi-fi available. It also has a SD card reader on the side for viewing photos etc. or extra storage. Also, there is a webcam at the top of the screen. If you haven't used the "Chrome" browser, it's very easy to use.

So you basically have to put your expectations in a laptop that costs 750 to 1750 dollars cheaper then what you are used to spending.Pros:Laptop does what you would expect, Chrome Web browser,  and the laptop as a whole is driven by the Google products you use.Plays Flash Video,  like youtubePlays video streaming services like Hulu, NetflixHas SD card slotHas pretty impressive battery life 5 hours of youtube videos.Supports two finger scrollingCons:While chrome OS works great to operate the computer and give you the Chrome browser.  You find yourself missing the ability to play other web browser based games.  Like my son's jumpstart.comCheap constructions shows with weird behavior like being able to click the track pad from the bottom front of the laptop.I did notice it struggle to play youtube videos with multiple open tabs,  something to do with limited ram, closing out some tabs that had other flash applications helped.Overall I think this is great for anyone who either A doesnt know a lot about computers since it saves you from microsoft updates, antivirus etc.  Also in comparison to tablets, it provides the desktop chrome browser experience with a real keyboard.So a good test if you could use this laptop as your main machine,  go into a current computer,  install chrome browser,  and live in it for a week..

(I'll go back and forth with my iPad and this.)  Well tonight, the Chromebook's trackpad stopped working.  WTF?!  ChromeOS forums on google say that the trackpad gets overly pressed down (or overly "depressed" ha hah) and the "fix" is to try and bend back from the bottom of the case.  Tried that and it was a no-go so it's going to get serviced.  I'm sending it back to Samsung for warranty service but c'mon -- 3.5 mos?!you get what you pay for ...  Maybe I should have gone for the real deal of the Macbook Air 11 inch ...Review Update #1:-----------------I have warmed to it as it has become my sofa device while watching TV in place of the iPad.  Still you can only check one gMail account at a time via a browser.  On the sly, I installed the native ChromeOS Remote Desktop on my work machine to get around the VPN issue and it works.  But the main drawback with the native ChromeOS Remote Desktop is while remoting into the host work desktop, the host work desktop screen actually displays the session instead of being hidden like how the native Windows Remote Desktop Protocol works.  I have to remember to shut off the host display if I'm remote desktopping.Initial Review:-----------------My first impressions having this for 24 hours.  Feeling a bit disappointed with the features it lacks as my original purpose was to use it to connect to my work network.  VPN support is very limited as of March 2013 -- Two types of LT2P/IPSec and an OpenVPN.  My office uses PPTP so this poses a huge problem.  And I found an app that allows you to connect directly to the Windows Remote Desktop protocol for work.I was expecting this to be the Cubic Zirconia to the Macbook Air and it is!  The one thing I noticed is opening the lid.  It may sound silly, but I've become used to opening a laptop like my Macbook Air with one hand by just flipping the screen open.  With the Samsung Chomebook, I have to use two hands -- one to hold the bottom part and the other hand to lift the lid with the screen.  Maybe the hinge needs some WD-40..

I needed a player quickly, and I wanted to add Amazon Prime video to my TV (which is sadly absent on Apple TV).The Blu-ray picture quality is good, and discs start quickly. The interface for the machine mimics what Sony uses on it's PS3. However, the PS3's home screen is displayed in HD with sharp contrast. The S5100's home screen is muddy and dull, but it's still functional. The graphics for the icons are a bit coarse and cheap looking compared to the PS3.The Internet video functions work dependably, but I found the search interface clumsy. It doesn't display predictive results of movie TV and movie titles like some players do, and it takes a little longer to find titles than some competing products.For the price, it's not bad. You get most of the benefits of a Roku box, and you also get a good Blu-ray player. Not perfect, but a keeper for under $100..

If the device can connect at all, the movie plays for about three minutes, then stops to slowly buffer, then plays for a minute or so, then stops to slowly download, and so on, taking hours to watch a one-hour program. After ignoring the problem for months, Sony offered a hardware download fix...if you can connect the Sony directly via LAN and if you can attach the tv to the player, and if you can follow the engineer's instructions. Also, a download repair disk can be made on a computer--if that computer runs Windows. Sorry Mac users.Don't buy this player..

It was slow to power on, slow to load, and flaky in its behavior. I upgraded to this one simply to get faster load times.Now, I use this for multiple functions: as my blu-ray/DVD player, in place of my roku, and as a lightweight frontend to my MythTV system and other digital media using uPNP/DLNA. I'm very happy to have one device to replace all of this. It simplified my movie room.I was very skeptical of replacing a purpose-built (and reference) device (the Roku) with this. However, I find the interface is actually *better* than the Roku 2 I have, more stable, and provides more information on the screen. The Rokus seem to be optimized for mid-size or small screens and are very spartan in what they show. The sony seems optimized for a large screen, which is great.The uPNP/DLNA support seems to be quite good, which allows me to use it in place of a HTPC for watching the occasional TV program from my MythTV setup in the movie room.Yes, the top is stupidly not flat, which I hate, but overall, it's a significant improvement for me..

They both worked fine for the first couple of weeks. The first unit started to flash between menus and noise when it booted and while you still could get it to play a DVD you couldn't get it to stream. The second one started having intermittent streaming problems after a couple of weeks. My son could magically tap on the box repeatedly and eventually get it to stop flashing and start streaming but it happened every time we used it. I could switch to the TV and streaming the same show worked flawlessly.  It's too bad because I really like they way they implemented the NetFlix and Amazon streaming menus. Much nicer than what's built into my TV. I never did find a way to edit the menu of streaming choices so if a service you wanted was at the bottom it would be a huge inconvenience. Luckily Amazon and Netflix are both near the top. Not so lucky the unit will only work for a couple of weeks. I suppose I could continue a monthly cycle of buy/return but it's time to find a more reliable option..

We've had a PS3 for sometime.  Really liked that Sony upgraded the PS3 to 3D free over the wire - very cool!!!  So the kids wanted the PS3 downstairs where we have set up for their stuff.  After we moved it, we started watching 3D movies so we really needed one for the main room.  This unit is very affordable and works great.  I can't say I'm a huge fan of the Sony GUI - but it works and I know it so it does make it easy to move from one room to the other.

This blu-ray player is a solid performer that does what it advertises, the only real issue is the way Sony connects to Netflix and other online streaming services is kinda convoluted. That's not so much a knock on this unit as it is with Sony. Once you're hooked up the connection seems solid and I've had no issues. I do have a 3D tv, but I haven't fired up any of my 3D discs yet to verify that part works, but I can't imagine it won't work as well as everything else has..

Sony has included a really cut down version of Amazon, nothing like you find in a Roku.  I have a large library of tv series and moves that I have bought from Amazon Instant Video, but the player claims that there is nothing in "My Video Library."  Even when I buy a video through the player, it doesn't recognize it in my video library.  You have to go through search to find what you own.  That really sucks.  Thus, the two stars.Update - contacted Sony and no help.  Now, the Blu-Ray player is quite good, but for Amazon Instant Library, look elsewhere.  I have a count of 587 titles (most of which are TV series) in my library, none of which this player can find.  You have to do a search for videos that you own and it is quite clumsy.  So, you will need a Roku for Amazon Instant Videos, because this really won't do the job.  And that is a shame for the player, otherwise, has much to go for it.  But I bought it so that I  wouldn't need a Roku, and in the end I bought one..

Firstly, this player does include HDMI cable in the box.  However, if TV is hung on the wall, a longer cable might be necessary.  Secondly, 3D picture looks amazingly good.  I used Life of Pi for testing 3D images.  The result was unbelievable on Samsung smart TV.Setup is probably the easiest one for all the electronics that I've used, and all feature work flawlessly.  The only issue that I have experienced is WiFi.  It seems that this player has hard time in receiving 5Ghz signal if router is not nearby, but no problem with 2.5Ghz.  By the way, my TV has no problem in connecting to 5Ghz, and both TV and this player are at the same location.  Since I can use TV for Video streaming, I really don't need this player to do so other than firmware update.Remote was easily integrated with Samsung touch pad during setup.  The only feature left for this player is really the video disk playback, which is really the best of all..

Makes it a snap to plug in new devices, and I heartily recommend doing that if you have one or more devices (Gaming system/TV/DVD/etc.) that needs to connect to a remote Cable/DSL router.  Once you configure the router, you only have to plug in a new device and it's good to go.Anyway, it took about 15 minutes to upgrade the firmware, download the app content, and set up an account at Sony (why, Sony?), and then another 10 to connect my Amazon Prime account to it, but it works well, and we've already watched several movies and TV shows that way.  I would imagine that Netflix and the others work as easily.One little niggly that I haven't figured out yet is that ever since I hooked up this device, when I am watching TV, there is a little indicator in the upper right corner of my TV that says &#34;DVD 101&#34;, even when the player is off.  It's only a minor annoyance, but I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of it.  Not 100% sure it's a product of this device, but the timing is suspect.The remote has all the features I need and want, it plays all the disks we put in it, and we didn't need to do any optimization of the colors or anything, though I will likely play around some with that later on..

Not sure what I was waiting for but I found it an easy transition from DVD and VHS.CONSTRUCTION: The crystal shaped housing is made of ultra glossy translucent plastic and is strange but endearing. Looks like a squished model of the Vegas Luxor Hotel. Sony likely choose plastic over metal to enhance Wi-Fi reception and cut costs. Nevertheless, they did a great job making a budget player look as nice as possible. I was surprised how tiny this device was compared to my prior Sony and Panasonic DVD players. The asymmetrical shape prevents stacking anything on top but it's so small not much will fit anyway.The backside of the BDP-S5100 is the most barren panel I've seen, sporting four lonely ports: HDMI, USB, ethernet and coaxial. Sony finally cut the cord with S-video, component and analog audio. This is not a product for owners of older AVR or TV components lacking HDMI. The coaxial digital output is intended for those plugging HDMI directly into their TV and requiring a separate audio feed to their AVR.SETUP: Basic setup was a as easy as falling off a log: plug HDMI cable into my Denon AVR-2313, plug in power plug, press button and I was spinning Blu-Ray disks. I suffered HDMI incompatibilities with past devices, so I used a high end cable this time,Monster MC 1000HD-1M Ultra-High Speed HDTV HDMI Cable (1 meter). So far no problems with HDMI handshake: my Denon AVR, Sharp Aquos and this Sony worked perfectly together. Incidentally, unlike my prior Sony products, no cables are included, so have one ready. The 1.4a spec and 17.8Gbps speed cable is the latest and greatest.I also setup the Sony on my Wi-Fi network: a couple strokes and a password and I was golden. However, if you can swing wired ethernet, movie streaming is better due to the increased bandwidth.USING THE BDP-S5100: For basic operation it doesn't get much easier than this. If you've played a DVD or CD you've fully qualified to operate a Blu-Ray player! I auditioned Blu-Ray disks of Prometheus and Grand Canyon Adventure and was treated to amazing eye and ear candy: sharp and vivid video and amazing surround sound. Spin-up is a little slow but that's par for the course for Blu-Ray and DVD players.The included IR remote is tiny and low budget but works okay. No attempt was made to match styling to the futuristic case of the player. The small buttons and lack of illuminated keys were painfully evident in the fading light of my living room. Obviously Sony expects owners will use it once for setup and toss it in favor of a Universal Remote Control, e.g.,Logitech Harmony 650 Remote Control (Silver). That's what I did. Minus 1/2 star for el cheapo remote.The Sony Entertainment Network interface for the internet and movie services is its main weakness. I'll be kind and say it works but is awkward. No lessons learned from iOS or Droid. No small wonder Apple and SamSung spanked Sony good during the last 10 years. So, I subtracted 1/2 star for a chunky GUI. The good news is you can setup your iPhone/iPad/Droid as a GUI controller, thereby removing a wee bit of awkward.Being a tightwad, I'm avoiding NetFlix but AmazonPrime streaming worked fine if you don't mind highly compressed video. The image and sound quality of AmazonPrime movies are a far cry from Blu-Ray. Oddly, I greatly prefer AmazonPrime streaming on my Mac Pro/Cinema Display: music easier navigation, more responsive controls and better image quality. Of course, it's nice to have movie steaming on the home theater for family and friends so I'm glad it's there. The interface for YouTube is as bad as it gets, so I'll stick to my computer.This version of the "Sony Entertainment Network," as well as Blu-Ray/DVD disk playback, is for the USA market. If you plan to use this product abroad, buy a multiple region model instead, e.g., SONY 3100 Multizone All Region Wi-Fi DVD Blu ray Player.The BDP-S5100 is billed as a do everything disk player. However wonderful it is for Blu-Ray and DVD, that wonder doesn't transfer to plain audio CDs. Waiting for the first track to play is painfully  S L O W. I'll continue using my old Denon 600F to play CDs: instant spin-up, pitch control, precise mid-track cluing and much better and faster track navigation.For barely a benjamin this is a keen piece of kit with vivid and sharp video, killer surround sound, internet features galore and simple setup. If Sony would overhaul the GUI via firmware update (unlikely), this would be a 5+ star product..

All of the wifi stuff was really not important to me since my (Vizio) TV already has wifi. But this seemed like the best buy to me and I figured I could compare wifi systems. For the price that I paid ($77, I think), it seemed like a bargain. Of course, I had recently tossed a three-month-old Sony dvd player (a really cheap model) in the garbage, so I was wary of buying anything from Sony, but Amazon is great when it comes to returns, so why not.And the funny thing is, I almost returned this player the day I set it up! It stopped playing in the middle of a disc (and it was a funny movie, was killing me not to be able to finish watching it) and I simply could not get it to play. It was an older disc and I thought perhaps it needed cleaning, so I took it out and wiped it off gently: still wouldn't play. Finally, the next morning in desperation, I put in another dvd and it worked fine. Hmmm. So I got an idea and put the failing dvd in the sink and rinsed it in cold water--and it worked!The player has worked fine since then so I'm sure it was that disc (what are the odds that the first disc I would play on the machine would be flawed? Just my luck, no kidding).I'm very impressed with the play quality of the machine and, in particular, with the upscaling quality of dvds. Wow, unless you've seen a good blu ray player upscaling a normal dvd, you can't imagine the quality improvement. I watched Eddy Murphy's fine movie &#34;Coming to America&#34; on dvd and I couldn't believe my eyes: that film is spectacular when seen through this player (and it is a dvd I bought years ago, so was not enhanced).The wifi was EXTREMELY simple to set up (if I can do it, anyone can do it), but I haven't used it much. As a test I called up Youtube and while I got the site to work, the lag time of uploading videos was torture. I'll try my Amazon prime with it soon and update this review.But as a dvd/blu ray player this gets high marks. The set up was utterly simple and logical (someone really thought out this set up) and I actually learned a few things along the way. My Vizio TV has 3 HDMI ports, so I just plugged it in and had the player running in a few minutes. I hope this lasts a while--it would be nice to regain my confidence in Sony because I like the design and engineering of most of their stuff. The player is small and the remote is easy to use (to turn on subtitles, for example, it's just a quick press of a single button).I was late to flat TVs, HDMI, blu ray, etc, but I have to say, I'm a total movie junkie and this system has done nothing but feed my addiction. :).

I bought one and it came and "no signal." It's pretty simple, I pulled my HDMI cord out of my ROKU and stuck in into the blu-ray player, did not work. I even did the switch HDMI cord/input thing.Even though I knew Amazon would take it back with no questions, I called SONY and got an RA number from the first player because, per SONY, "the item needs service." Working in the electronics business, I already knew this. But I wanted to make sure SONY declared this as well.I didn't rush into a review though. Every now and then, an item will be defective. I called Amazon and they were suppose to send one overnight. For some reason it did not come and another one was dispatched for overnight. Today, both arrived and both were defective.Given the other reviews on Amazon, it is more than safe to say there is a major issue with these players. At least the ones that Amazon have. The Amazon customer service representative helping me with my refund/return shipping of all three players said she was pulling the add so this player could be reviewed.After finalizing things with the returns she stated that she was going to expedite this add being pulled until this issue is resolved. I see it is still up at the time so beware.I personally know someone who has this player and it is dynamite. That's what made me seek it out in the first place. But, it was not bought off Amazon. I still like Amazon and will still use them but they need to address this player, now.***UPDATE***I did go to a local department store and got a Samsung BD-FM59. Not a lot out there about them yet. I paid 10 dollars less and it looks real classy and it has a dual core possessor and is every bit as good of a player as the best Sony blu-ray on the market (BDP S790).The main differences is that this Samsung plays region A flicks only. But, it works great and looks great. The purpose of this update it to show that it was not a defective HDTV that prevented the player from working.

If you have never heard of it, it is a fantastic solution that allows you to use Roku (as well as all your portable devices and remote computers, including ones on the internet-at-large) to stream all of the movies on your computer, regardless of the format. On Roku, you can browse the movie collection on your computer using a slick interface and watch it in full resolution. (This is only if you have a fast connection like a home wireless network, and you need to configure it to do this- an easy settings change.) If your computer can play it, so can your Roku. The key to this is because all the transcoding of the video file happens on your computer so all Roku has to do is play the video stream. The result is that you can easily fast-forward and rewind, as well and have the jump-back feature like the TiVo has. This was the primary reason that I bought the Roku as it is a lot easier to use than trying to connect your computer directly to your TV and muddling about with computer controls to watch movies. The Plex interface on Roku is easy to use and very slick. It does nice things like look up movie data so you have the cover art, theme music, and movie info for you to peruse as you are browsing your library. Finally, there is the &#34;Plex it!&#34; feature which you can use with your computer's browser, so that when you find a video on the internet on your computer, you want to queue it up for later to watch on your TV, and it will appear in your movie queue in Plex on Roku, regardless of the video format! This also gets around the one annoying thing about Roku and that it doesn't have a native YouTube channel for some reason..

I can watch any show imaginable, learn how to cook or do yoga, have a fun time with friends playing Jeopardy!, and so many other things. And let's not forget one of the coolest things ever, a headphone jack in the remote! This has come in handy so many more times than I thought, like using a treadmill. Now I don't have to turn up the volume to drown out the sound of me pounding on the treadmill while running.Let me give some reasons I prefer a Roku to other devices:Roku doesn't really have a stake in the selling of movies. What I mean by this is that Apple wants you to buy iTunes stuff from the Apple TV. Google wants you to use Google stuff wile using a Chromecast. Amazon wants you to use Amazon services while using their box. Roku gives you amazing access to YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Video, Crackle, Vudu, and the list goes on. SO MUCH SUPPORT AND VARIETY.It is super fast. I used to use a Blu Ray player with Netflix on it to watch Netflix, but it took forever to load the Netflix app, and then the individual descriptions, and then the movie. But this little guy is super fast and I never have to wait for anything.The Ethernet Port. Obviously WiFi is great, but how many times have things slowed down for no reason, leading to you resetting the router? This never has happened to me with a wired connection, and it's good to have just in case.I now try to convince everyone to buy a Roku, and I will be sure to get more as I get more TVs..

First and for me the best feature is the speed. I had a Roku HD in the bedroom for years and we recently moved away from cable and put Roku's in all the room. I tried some refurbished Roku HD's did not have much luck and sent them back to many freezes and to many channel glitches. So I bit the bullet and got two of the Roku 3's. I love them. They are probably close to the advertised 5x faster as far as loading channels and navigating the menus. When you are used to cable your hole life this kind of speed matters. Second is the upgraded remote. Has a wifi connection and motion sensors for playing games. I have only tried the free Angry Birds game but was very surprised how responsive the controller was. I think it works better then my wii remote. (I know they are Apples and Oranges as far as tech goes but it works) lastly is the head phone jack in the remote. It works (for the most part) they have been a couple of cut out here and there and you have to unplug and re-plug headphones back in to reactive the sound. Not that big of a deal. A word of caution!!! If the remote headphones do cut out or get removed the audio automatically starts back on the TV. So If you are using the headphone feature to watch some &#34;Adult content&#34; that you don't want anybody else to hear.

Got it for the great price of $89 plus $5 for an HDMI cable not included.Had a major quandary as to whether to go with Google Chrome HDMI dongle or Apple TV. I own HD Tivo, iPhone, iPad, and iMac desktop so initially thought Apple TV was the way to go. Also really liked the price of the Google Chrome.I think these devices are all excellent but each had specific draw backs depending on the usage. A discussion of the specs on each device is way beyond the scope of what I want to convey in this review. So instead I will outline what type of user I am. I have an HD Tivo that records most of the TV content and some movies that I want to see. Problem is that my Tivo has limited storage and newer Tivo (Roamio) is not yet ready to be reliably compatible with systems that require a tuning adaptor (as quoted from Tivo customer service). As a result my box sometimes fills up and misses episodes that I later have to try and catch on the web one way or another. I am also a big Amazon Prime and HBO to Go user especially when traveling when I stream to my iPad. I also watch TV series on Prime that I missed first time round (eg Sons of Anarchy seasons 1-4). I pay for cable with all premium channels so do not want to pay for Hulu, iTunes downloads, or Netflix too. I rarely want to stream music or video from my computer or iPad to my TV and in fact Airplay is not compatible w my 3 year old iMac do there goes Apple TV.So for me, the fact that none of the other devices mentioned streams Prime and the fact that Roku has the most free content of any of the devices this was the natural choice for me. The headphone jack in the Roku 3 which allows me to watch the Roku stream with headphones and keep the TV silent while my wife can sleep is a major bonus.So how has it worked out since I installed the Roku3?First installation was a BREEZE. Plug in HDMI and power cord. Menu comes right up. Roku found all my Wifi networks immediately. Picked a network and was off to the the races. Roku produces a code you must enter on their website (did it on my iPad) then create a Roku account. I was streaming within 5 minutes of set up.Picked a bunch of channels as favorites and have been streaming Amazon Prime since. Ease of set up and use get 5 stars. I have not yet found a downside. Speed of the interface which apparently was a problem in the past is a non-issue with the Roku 3.Finally I will say Chrome works a bit differently than I thought it would and is an interesting device but was not ideal for me. Would definitely recommend good research before purchasing. Best for those w Android devices.All in all I am very happy with my choice and would not trade for any of the other options at this time..

Would not connect to any channels.I decided to do a factory reset.  After the reset, the remote would not work, so the product isn't useable at all.My original 3 year old Roku still works fine.  Very disappointed in this model.Original review below.I've had the original Roku for 3 years.  Just purchased the Roku 3.  Both are great.Since I already had a Roku, and two Apple TVs, I purchased the new Roku solely for the Time Warner app.  I wanted high definition channels without paying for a second Time Warner box.  The App is excellent.  My wife's Lifetime Channels come in on perfect HD.  Many more.  My one disappointment  is that I can't get my local (cincinnati reds), games on this App.  Those games are on Fox Sports.  There are several Fox Sports Ohio channels, but they show soccer, high school football, etc.It is worth purchasing/upgrading, just for this App.  A tiny box that can be nearly invisible, gives you a lot of worthwhile HD stations.Be very clear.  This does replace your cable box and save you a monthly fee for that box.  But - you will not get quite a few stations.  It gets enough to make it very worthwhile.It also does not use internet bandwidth.  It goes through your separate cable TV band,With the addition of this second Roku (my 3 year old Roku still is working perfectly), I now have boxed up both of my Apple TVs.  They just don't compare to the Roku.Roku is really a dream come true, especially for Prime members.  Free instant via Prime.

Doesn't stream stuff purchased or rented from iTunes. In the way of video for me, that would be everything. I already have numerous devices that stream Amazon and Netflix, so that functionality is of no use to me. In fact, the Netflix UI on the Roku is bad compared to other devices and requires constant restarting for it to update episodes (watch episode of TV show, click "more episodes", get list of episodes only up to and including what you've already watched, restart app, watch another episode, repeat process). Costs the same as an Apple TV, so I fail to see the advantage. BTW, if you are having the problem that everyone else is having getting Netflix to connect, try turning off the firewall on your router.

Actually use the Roku more.  Channels are great.  YouTube was recently added and so other than the airplay option of Apple and flawless downloading practice of content delivery of ITunes to the AppleTv which is fast and flawless, the Roku is better.  Roku doesn't have a great video/tv rental option like Apple but many great channels and even games.  Angry Birds works well and is great on the big screen.  Tried a few rentals on the Roku system movie and tv menus but they aren't good with a lot of delay and buffering stalls.  It's not the system but how those companies have chosen to compress and send content.  Headphone option for quiet night listening and motion controlling remote are a plus and better than AppleTv, this uses standard AA batteries too, unlike the Apple Remotes which requires those stupid quarter looking batteries.  I hate buying those.  Plus the Apple Remotes are so small the fall down couch crack abysses to be lost forever.  Roku remote is larger, not as loose-able and can controlled without line of sight and thus no moving your arm to point...unlike Apples.  That sounded really sad that I prefer a remote that requires only finger movement!  It's the little things though that make the experience better.  If you primarily use this for Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, some games and other content channels (Aereo is great for live TV and DVR), then go with this Roku.  If you Airplay a lot (why? I do it but not tons and nothing that isn't fine on the ipad) or rent and watch movies or tv shows a lot then Apple TV may be a better option.  Menu and navigation is great with both.  Apple has a slight advantage, but the Roku is just fine.  Overall you can't lose with either, but for my viewing habits with Aereo, Netflix, PBS Kids, News, and special interests I like the Roku and it's diverse channel options.

This also runs YouTube, and lets you cast from your tablet or phone onto the Roku.  It's similar to a ChromeCast, without the lag.CPU is upgraded in the Roku 3, so the interface is very responsive. It supports DNLP to play from TVersity or Windows media.  It also supports playing direct attached media from a microSD / TransFlash, or from USB2.  You can also use TWONKY Beam to send video or audio from your device to the Roku.The included remote is radio, likely bluetooth, with return audio and a headset plug with volume.  It also supports video games.  You can still use an older, IR Roku remote, some universal remotes, etc.This supports both WiFi (802.11bgn) or 100mbit RJ45.  This is a win if you have interference from bluetooth, neighbor routers, cordless phones, etc.A few new apps auto-install, and M-Go has integration to the main menu.  It would be nice if this integration were extended to other apps, but it's not a problem.The power supply is 12-volt, 1-amp.  It looks similar to the RokuLT but don't mix them up.

Amazon isn't available on Apple TV, and the Sony Playstation is complete crap as a streaming box. Sony seems to force an update download every week, and it takes an eternity to boot up and load the Amazon App. The Roku is "always on" in low-power standby and the Amazon app loads quickly.The other major plus of Roku is the fact that it runs the Vudu app. This app is essential if you own any Sony Blu ray disks. Vudu will allow you to access and stream your Sony "Ultraviolet" library. When you buy a Sony DVD which includes streaming, it can only be streamed via "Ultraviolet."I use Amazon Prime and buy the occasional Sony Blu Ray, so I really needed this device in my home theatre. It's better than dealing with the awful Playstation updates and slow bootup.Now, if you want it for the "channel selection" and Netflix, you are out of your mind for buying this over Apple TV. Apple TV is superior in every way.The user interface of Apple TV is better. the Apple looks better and is more intuitive. Apps on Apple TV load almost instantly. There is more wait-time when using Roku (but not nearly as bad as Sony PS3 or Sony connected Blu Ray players).  All Apple TV apps use the same UI. Most Roku Apps (including Netflix) are inconsistent and suffer from clumsy ugly design.The Roku has more "channel" selection than Apple at first glance. Once you browse through them, you'll realize that most of the "channels" are simply video podcasts. Apple TV has a podcast app which will allow easier access to all of this content. The Roku "channel" store is pretty useless and full of junk content.Both Roku and Apple TV can stream content from you film library on your computer. If you already use iTunes, you are already set up for streaming to an Apple TV. On Roku, you will need to set up one of several clumsy attempts at providing the same service.The wifi antenna to the Roku must be weaker than the Apple TV. I get solid HD streams from Netflix with Dolby 5.1 on Apple TV. On Roku, I often get a blurry picture which may (or may not) improve, and stereo sound. This is using the same 16MB ATT UVerse 802.11n connection and same Wifi router.Tech support form Roku is above-average. I contacted them using text chat to try to improve my Netflix streaming. A knowledgable rep spent quite a bit of time with me. We eventually determined that the device signal was weak and I would not get the same performance as with Apple TV (despite being ten feet from a top-shelf router).The Roku remote is flaky at times. I think it may go into sleep mode and take a moment to wake up. From time to time it just doesn't respond. The headphone option on the Remote is killer. I live in an apartment building and I love being able to use headphones at night.This is a decent device, but compared to Apple TV, it is a bit half-baked. It is nuts that it retails for the same price as Apple TV. It is the best option if you need access to Amazon Prime and Vudu. Just be warned: this is far from a 5-star device, regardless of the reviews here.An apt comparison of this device and Apple TV is to think back to MP3 players six years ago. You could buy an iPod and get excellence and a nice user experience, or you could pay less for a clumsy off-brand MP3 player. The Roku is like the off-brand MP3 player. The only difference is that this thing is just as expensive as the iPod..

We bought two of the XD version and loved them, but the unit is the bedroom was a long way from the WiFi connection and would sometimes lose connection.  The Roku 3 had both wireless and wired Ethernet to connect to the Internet so we bought two new ones to replace our older versions.The new remote now has more buttons on it which we specifically didn't want, a headphone jack that we never use and motion sensors to play video games with, which we don't do.  There's an annoying LED on the remote that flashes every time you move it.  The new volume control on the side of the remote only controls the headphone volume so it's useless for us.  If it controlled the volume coming out of the TV, that would great, but it doesn't.The screen format of the old unit was simple, straightforward and consistent between content providers.  Now the format varies and providers like Netflix have completely ruined the experience with a complicated and non-consistent interface.  There are also a large number of &#34;suggestions&#34; of content to view which is annoying.  We're not against that idea, but would prefer it if there was a separate &#34;Suggestion&#34; channel that we could look at if we wanted to, not more advertising blasting us in the face all the time.I don't know if it's Netflix or Roku, but since the content is being delivered via Roku, I'll blame them.  Periodically, the Netflix channel demands that I put in my user name and password.  My username is 18 characters long and my password is 10 characters long.  Typing all this in on the Roku remote is worse than tedious, especially since it appears to be time triggered and we have 2 Roku devices to do it on.  I almost canceled our Netflix account over it.  Roku should make this against there rules, as the physical device is controlling access to every channel and demanding that the user type it in periodically is stupid.So, why did I give it 2 stars?  Well, the wired Ethernet connection works fine and the picture is great..

The other gushing reviews cover the good features so well that I would suggest simply reading those.  I'm writing this to say what those don't say: installation can be an absolute nightmare due to one simple lack.This device does NOT support static IP addresses.  Chances are pretty good that you'll just say "Huh?  What's that?" or perhaps "Eh?  Who uses those?"  If you're in the group (likely the vast majority) that rely on your wi-fi/router to provide DHCP support and don't know what either DHCP or an IP address is, this won't be a problem for you.However, if you're not using DHCP (like me), you probably have very good reasons for not doing so.  The most likely being that you can't, because the devices on your network don't support it.  In that case, do NOT buy a Roku.  It won't work and there is no fix other than adding a device to your network that does provide DHCP.IMHO, this is an unconscionable flaw and a deliberate one, too.  It's such a basic feature that even if the Roku had "requires DHCP" plastered all over it, I would not have believed it.  I've been using IP-networked devices for 25 years and have never seen one that didn't support static IP assignment.  And, it's not hard to provide; it's probably even already there, but blocked (it's an essential development and testing feature for IP devices).I downgraded my rating by 2 stars for this lack.--Setting up static IP assignment via DHCP requires the MAC address for your Roku: stamped on the back of the unit (wired & wireless), from settings->network->wired/wireless, or from settings->about.  The last two may not be available until after basic install, a slight chicken & egg issue.  In that case, you can access the "secret" page: press Home x5, FF x3, RW x2.  Or, you can always use a sniffer.  Obtaining and configuring DHCP for your network is an exercise for the reader.-- edit: some details learned while using the RokuI really like the Roku (once it's installed).  These two little details differed from my own expectations.  Knowing in advance would not have changed my mind on buying or not-buying, but it's always nicer to know exactly what you're getting.First, for lefties, the headphone volume is more friendly for a righty's thumb than for a lefty's fingers (I'm a lefty for remotes).  If you plan on using the headphone feature and fiddle with the volume using your left hand, you might be slightly put out.  The other buttons don't care which hand you use.Second, for HBO & Comcast users, Comcast appears to have declared war on Roku and refuses to support HBO-Go for Roku.  Their plan has backfired, though.  I just canceled my entire Comcast cable-TV subscription as a result of this.  If they had supported HBO-Go, I'd have kept it (you need an HBO subscription to access HBO-Go).  If you're determined, you can side-step Comcast's Roku-specific block and access HBO-Go via Plex on Roku.  Plex requires some extra (free) software and a PC or Mac to run it and act as a Plex server..

In the end, I chose a refurbished Roku 3 (90 day warranty and Prime shipping, 'like new' out of the box) to get the faster processor (5 times faster) and dual-band (2.5Ghz and 5Ghz) capabilities, with the perks of the newly acquired YouTube channel.I own several Roku boxes, and for the past 5 years have used them to stream Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon videos.  I find that the other channels (while nice to have) are not often used in my household, but since dropping cable and seeking streaming media to replace lost programming, I find I appreciate having so many viewing options.I also own an Apple TV, which I like primarily for mirroring from my iPad to my HDTV.  I also like that it has a YouTube channel, but both are infrequently used, albeit nice to have from time to time.  The ability to look at my iTunes library; listen to music, view videos and photos, make this a great choice too.  But if you find that most of your video rentals are through Amazon, you'd be disappointed in the Apple TV as Amazon isn't supported.The Roku 3's remote and its need to be paired (mine did out of the box...) is odd, but if you read through the directions, it's simple to do.  Just like the rest of the Roku set-up and use.  I like the headphone jack addition to the remote, which makes it great for late night viewing.WHY ROKU 3 WORKS FOR METhe speed with which this one moves through the User Interface (UI) is remarkably fast compared to previous versions, and it's made it easier and more enjoyable to find what you want to watch.  My other Roku's (LT, XS, HD, original), all lag way behind this one in terms of 'zippiness', but again, it's a processor thing.The dual-band feature is a big deal.  TIP: Leave one bandwidth free exclusively for streaming purposes in your home, and then put the Roku 3 on that band.  Your viewing experience will be stable and speedy!I have always loved Roku for its ability to stream content from Amazon, Netflix and Hulu Plus.  I love them even more for the improvements they've made in the speed and features of the Roku 3, and the channels that they keep adding to improve the experience.REGARDING GOING CABLE FREE WITH ROKUIf you have cut your ties with cable or satellite, or have a room that isn't wired for such, buy a Roku. We've done it along with the help ofMohu Leaf Ultimate Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna(check out my video review of it via the product link) andWinegard FL5500A FlatWave Amplified Razor Thin HDTV Indoor Antennaover-air antennas.Yes, there are some ongoing subscription costs for Netflix ($8 a mo), Hulu Plus ($8 a mo) and Amazon Prime ($79 a year).  You also have to register the device, and may end up purchasing the occasional movie from RedBox, Amazon or others, and/or subscribing to a sports channel.  Despite these costs, you'll still be saving hundreds per year, and regain your freedom from contracts.NOTE:  I have used my Blu-ray player to wirelessly access Netflix and Hulu Plus, but find that the Roku 3 is so much faster, it's well worth the money and lack of frustration. Apple TV is not as fast as the Roku 3 either, but it does have that 'mirroring' perk, and access to my iTunes library so it sits next to the Roku 3, but gets used much less often.NOTE: Go into SETTINGS on your Roku once you get things set up.  Change things related to sound (stereo sound by default, with surround as an option) and picture (720P by default, with an option for 1080P).  You can also change how the homepage appears (which channels pop up), screensavers, etc... via this menu.NOTE: Set-up will take about 30 minutes between entering in your password for your network, and having the Roku due an update and install channels.  If you have Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Amazon, you'll also want to have your usernames and passwords handy to get those channels online.  If you install a microSD card, the channel info will be stored on that card so that channels will load a smidge faster.UPDATE: 2/1/14I've enjoyed the 1st Season of Downton Abbey via Amazon Prime Instant Video on my refurbished Roku 3, and I have to say the speed of navigation is a noticable improvement over other models I've owned!  Fast forwarding, picking up after a pause, and the initial streaming of the programming is all quick and enjoyable to use. NO buffering issues!  Part of that is the ROKU and part of it is the channel that's streaming to it combined with your internet connection.One issue that occurs occasionally is upon initially going to the home screen I don't always see the app pictures.  I can navigate to hover over where I expect them to be and see text that says 'Netflix' or similar, and once I click I then see the app pictures.  It only happens at first when I've switched from TV to the HDMI input of the Roku via my AV receiver.  I don't know if it's the Roku, the HDMI cable or the AV receiver, but one day I'll troubleshoot it and perhaps figure it out.  For now, it's a quirk and I just roll with it.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this ROKU version.  Even resuming from buffering errors due to streaming from Netflix have been quickly resolved.Be sure that during set-up you update your ROKU in Settings.  That will give you the latest firmware and channel updates.UPDATE: 4/23/14I use this Roku every day to supplement my free, over-the-air TV in HD.

If I want to connect or disconnect a drive, I just select the associated button and press it. I do not have to keep removing and reinserting the drives unless I need to carry them on a trip. The buttons are distanced enough for who with fat fingers.I might have one concern that the on/off switch is a little too soft to toggle. I have a cat which uses to hang around my laptop. I am afraid some day she is curious enough to tap on the blue light (button) while the device is in use. That might cause damage to files being written.

In retrospect, this isn't as useful as I thought it would be, but it is still I fairly nice feature. It is just really not that often that I have something plugged in and I don't want to use it.Small and compactCons:The cable for this is insanely small. To make this product worthwhile I also bought an AmazonBasics USB Extension Cable. I have the entire hub set up on the top corner of my desk but wired down to the back of my computer. I can see how many people would not need an extension cable, however, if they are just setting this up on a laptop or have a spare port on a keyboard.Anything related to audio doesn't really work with this hub. My headset / USB Speakers or small things like that always end up receiving an annoying hum as feedback when plugged in here but work totally fine if plugged in anywhere else on my computer.

The expandable memory slot on the MemoPad never worked. It constantly randomly became unmounted which was extremely frustrating. In the middle of reading a PDF file or viewing a video it would suddenly vanish. Then there was the software problems. The app I wanted to use ran ok though one major function did not work at all on the MemoPad. Even when the app did work, it was kind of slow and sluggish. I did not trully realize how slow it was until I switched to the Nexus 7 and it runs fast and perfect. The MemoPad is ideal for people who want to check email and watch netflix movies with headphones (while the video quality is excellent the speakers are not always top notch in a noisy environment) and browse the internet and do other basic things such as, well, taking memos.

The tablet will randomly lock up, and reboot up to 15 times every day, sometimes rendering the tablet unusable for an hour or more.  I have reflashed the software, updated to the newest image available(which supposedly fixed some other issues) and this tablet is still doing the same thing.  Do yourself a big favor and do some Google searching about the problems with these tablets.  I am thoroughly disappointed in both Asus and Google for releasing a product that clearly was not ready for market.  I understand the first generation Nexus is a great tablet, but until the FHD version is fixed, I would strongly advise you to consider either the first generation nexus, or another product all together.Update: 10/8/13So the latest software update (JSS15R)has the tablet running better, only 2 random reboots in the past two weeks. I can live with that.  Starting to enjoy it, but still not positive it's going to be trustworthy...  Upgraded to 3 starsUpdate 2: 1/26/13Tablet has been trouble free since the latest update (4.4.2)  So I guess it was software and not hardware, thank goodness!

No app to support it and no web browser that will support it either.  I did finally find a browser that would support playing an Amazon Prime video, but it was terrible!  The video would freeze and be behind the audio track and no full screen!  Google's answer was "use our video service"!  Amazon had no answer.  What is so tuff here?

As an interesting point, this unit is made by ASUS, but they provide NO support for it!!!!  Google does not provide any hardware support for this either!3.  One of the main reasons I wanted this, besides Amazon Prime video, was to be able to download pictures from my Nikon to work on.  Carrying around a laptop is a real pain and I was able to do this with my Ipad with no issue so figured it should work with the Nexus.  Well, guess again.  The camera would connect, the Nexus would show me the pictures on my camera, but when you went to download them it would only download 4 to 10 pictures and then quit!!  Google support was no help!  Nikon was no help, and ASUS would not talk to me because they do not support this product!!!!!4.  The size of the unit is not very good for anything other than video!!!  It is long and narrow.  Makes reading a book on it a pain and working with any type of document a pain.  If this fits in a pocket, you must have one heck of a pocket!!  The screen is smaller than an Ipad mini and smaller than the Amazon Fire HD.This may be a very good unit if you do nothing more than play games and use Google video service.  However, it is NOT great for reading a book, watching video from someone other than Google, or for working with photography.My suggestion if you need something this small is to wait for the new release of the Apple Ipad mini as it is supposed to have Retina display.  Yes, it does cost a lot more, but then again, a inexpensive unit that does not function is not really much of a value.PS, just so that you know, even though Google admits that their GPS does not work and that they do not support camera downloads or Amazon video or any type of FLASH support, they will NOT refund your money without taking out a 15% stocking fee and making you pay to return the item!!!!!!!  When was the last time you bought an item that had a dead feature and you were made to pay to take it back?.

The tablets I've owned that I could compare this one to included theHP TouchPad Wi-Fi 32 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer, the original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1,Apple iPad MD366LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, Black) 3rd Generation,ASUS Transformer TF300 T-B1-BL 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Blue)(with matching dock), the aforementioned Nexus 7,Google Nexus 10 (Wi-Fi only, 16 GB), and myMicrosoft Surface (32GB).  The Nexus 7 has turned out to be a worthy addition to this collection.  Here's why.PROS+ Lightweight build.  Last year's Nexus 7 was hardly a slouch in this department, and was more than portable enough for most.  The iPad Mini (which I purchased as a gift) is slightly thinner, but it doesn't really make any drastic improvements.  This device is markedly lighter than both, which makes it surprisingly easier in the hands.  You wouldn't think there was much room for improvement here (given the first generation was quite nice), but ASUS managed to pull it off.+ Great, understated looks.  Sure, the top and bottom bezels are a little larger, but compared to last year's Nexus 7, this device has a lot more "class" to it.  The exterior bezels now lack the bright silver banding, which helps the screen melt away into the bezels.  That's all the better, since as an LCD panel (which won't achieve the same black-levels as a AMOLED display from Samsung) is the centerpiece of this device, it's best to keep your focus on it.  The back is nice and smooth, with the word "NEXUS" inscribed into the back.  The branding is non-obtrusive and otherwise non-existent on a device that all around has a sophisticated, matte look to it.+ Powerful performance.  Without getting into too much technical information, the processor in this device (a rebranded Qualcomm Snapdragon 600) is significantly more powerful than the Nexus 7's Tegra 3 in every way.  It's also more power efficient, so you can watch your movies and games for longer, all while enjoying stunning looks.  Which brings me to the next two points...+ Beautiful screen.  This is a Full HD (1080p) panel in a 7" package.  The best effort prior to this was Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD 8.9, which had a 1080p panel as well.  At present, this device has the sharpest screen (in terms of PPI) of any device, even compared against Apple's iPad 3 and Samsung's Nexus 10.  Colors are sharp and vivid and the screen has no motion blurring or ghosting.  My unit also doesn't have any light bleed, although I've seen some people complaining about it.+ Better hardware for longevity.  You may have heard of the recent kerfuffles around last year's Nexus 7, which has started to slow down and lag for many users.  The problem lay in how the device managed its onboard storage-- which, to put it mildly, was poor.  If you didn't mind tinkering and rooting your device, you could fix the issue, but that should never be a requirement in a consumer product.  Luckily enough, the refresh's hardware boasts better memory and Android 4.3 will automatically keep things in good shape, so you won't have to worry about this.+ Sound is pretty good for a small device.  It gets plenty loud without much distortion.  Unfortunately, ASUS elected to keep the speakers on the back for some unknown reason (especially with nice bezels on the top and bottom that could have provided stereo in landscape-- which is where you'd need those speakers most).  This is especially perplexing considering how well-reviewed the speakers on the Nexus 10 and HTC One were-- both packed front-facing stereo speakers.+ Android 4.3 under the hood means you've got a faster, more secure mobile experience than any previous version.  Even if you're primarily an iOS user, the Nexus 7 is definitely worth a look.  The Play Store's got almost all the heavy hitters you'd use on a tablet (such as Amazon Kindle, Netflix, a YouTube experience second to none, and the full power of Google's own services as an example), as well as some amazing Android-exclusive apps (such as Press, a beautiful RSS reader for those who prefer to take their news this way).  Many people have griped in the past about Android and tablet apps, but...+ You'll also find a mature and solid ecosystem waiting for you.  As a 7" device, the refreshed Nexus 7 sits between traditional 10"-class tablets and the smartphone, meaning it can use apps designed for either very well.  Although most Android apps are still designed for phones, they scale up very well on the Nexus 7 (nothing like Apple's frankly laughable 2x zoom mode available on the iPad/iPad Mini).  Android tablet apps are also getting better by the day, so unless there really is that one killer app you can't leave behind, give it a whirl!+ Android 4.3 also provides multiuser support, so if you have this tablet in any social settings (having friends over, throwing a party, and so on), you can easily set up a guest profile for friends to use while keeping your own stuff under lock and key.  It's also great as a family tablet-- share the device among multiple members while keeping everyone's stuff separate.  Things have also gotten a lot faster since the 4.2 days, so if you had any issues before, give it another go.+ Notification light!  Hoorah!  Long-time Android users will instantly recognize how useful these things are, and as a casual device to leave lying around your desk, the light makes things much better.  Let's say you're walking by a coffee table and you receive an e-mail.  With an iOS device, the screen will light up for a few seconds, and a pulsing icon will let you know that you've got a message of some sort.  And both iOS and Android handsets without a light (such as last year's Nexus 7) will beep or produce a tone to let you know the same.  But if you happen to walk by after those time out, you'd never know that you have something waiting for you.  With a notification light, you get a persistent, unobtrusive and instantly-visible way of seeing that something's waiting.+ Great battery life.  Although the battery's smaller than last year's Nexus 7 (probably to slim down the build), Android 4.3 and the newer Snapdragon processor make for quite a powerful (hehe) package that will run all day and then some without trouble.  I have yet to charge mine after receiving it two days back, and I'm still looking at 50% remaining after heavy use.Of course, this isn't all sunshine and daisies.  Make sure you're making an informed purchase.  Here are some cons I've noticed.CONS- The cameras are forgettable.  Good enough for video calling, but it won't even replace most smartphone cameras.- I'm having screen lift issues in the upper left hand-hand side of my tablet, which means the back creaks a little if I press on it.  It doesn't impact functionality at all, and hopefully it may go away after a while, but my launch-day 8GB Nexus 7 from last year also had this issue.  needless to say, I'm a little annoyed that they weren't more rigorous this time around.  Not something you should have to deal with as a consumer.- Top and bottom bezels make the device a little larger than it has to be.  Depending on how you use this device, it could actually be a major pro for you (as wider bezels give you a better surface to grip without accidentally touching the screen).  For me, it's a definite con, since I think it makes the device look a tad silly.- Slightly less grippy than last year's model.  The refresh loses the dimpled texture of the original, which makes it a little more "slick" in the hand.  It's not awful by any means, but do keep in mind that it can slide a little more on surface than you'd expect.- The buttons.  Are maddening.  They're basically flush with the chassis, and while there's solid feedback on all three (power, volume up, volume down), they're very close to one another and feel exactly the same.  Expect to hit volume up a lot trying to wake this device up.All in all, I'd say buy this one with confidence.  It's well worth the upgrade if you're on the fence, and if you're new to the Android tablet land, this is an amazing place to start.  As a Nexus device, it'll get long software support and fast upgrades, so you'll always be getting the latest and greatest.  Questions?  Let me know in the comments below!.

They advertise better battery life with this model, but I don't see a major difference between the FHD and the original.  I mainly use the tablet for working at night from bed, and watching Netflix.Both the original and the FHD have more horsepower then most tablets on the market.  If you have the original and are happy with it, their is no compelling reason to upgrade.  It is unlikely you need the extra power, unless you are an early adopter like myself.One thing I miss from the original is the back.  The original Nexus 7 had a nice rubber-like back, and new one is pretty much just plastic.If you want to take advantage of wireless charging, you will need a wireless charging base.

In the case of phones they sell these at what seems like close to cost with no-contract (one of the main reasons I like them).I have used both the 2012 and 2013 version of this product. I feel like the price is totally reasonable and really an amazing value for what you get. The big improvement here is more power, more memory, but most noticeable a much improved screen.

Best of all I was able to get a Bluetooth keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse and they  work well together.  I already have dozens of apps on the tablet and still have 21GB left.  My last tablet had 8GB and was filled before I had much on it.Can't say enough about the screen.  The HD quality is incredible.  It's easy to read the small letters, even with my elderly eyes.

There have been very few times when it didn't figure out what I was asking.I would absolutely recommend the 2013 Nexus 7 to anyone looking to buy a tablet.

But I seem to have received a good unit, no such problems. When comparing to the 2012 model, it's a huge improvement in almost any regard:- The new screen is much better than the old one, brighter and better resolution.  Also, the new screen doesn't flicker anymore at low brightness settings.- Noticeable improvement in CPU speed. Qualcomm makes much better SOCs than nvidia, much snappier and no lag anymore. I can't emphasize how much  more enjoyable this tablet is to use compared to the old one.- Much improved storage speed, programs install much faster and finally no lag anymore during normal usage.-  Battery life is much better, lasts noticeably longer than the old model. The only quibble I have i have that the battery seems to drain a little faster when idle. Eg, 6% over night, even with WiFi, GPS, background data, etc. turned off. Maybe they will fix that in some software update.- They fixed issue with light sensor reading being all over the place, making auto brightness more reliable.- Lighter, nicer form factor, and sturdier feel.- Stereo speakers are nice, max volume much better than previous model.- The old model had the nasty habit of skipping music playback while e.g. surfing the web. New one also doesn't do this anymore.- Headphone jack on top much more practical.Overall, if you have the first generation Nexus 7 and any of the issues listed above bother you, don't hesitate to upgrade, you won't be disappointed..

They used these flimsy USB connectors that failed on a regular basis. With the Passport series, much of this has been solved.I need about 5gb of backup overall. After researching a number of backup options, I decided it was simply best to go with a drive backup (as opposed to tape or cloud). For the cost, the WD Passport series (with USB 3) gives me the size and speed I need. Mind you, I am an individual business, not a corporate group.Finally and fwiw, I just retired an older WD My Book in favor of this drive. So it was not the manufacturer, but the particular drive.

Bad drives can be luck of the draw, but a little digging and diagnostics on how my drives failed turned up a very real quality control issue with the controller card for the more recent Passport drives.If the WD forums and my 2/4 drives failing are any indication of current or future performance, then I recommend you stay away from this drive in particular. If you do purchase one, be sure to back up to an additional drive or back-up service.If your drive has failed, all is not lost. Since most of the failures are caused by the controller board, and not the actual hard drive mechanics, you can fix the dead drive for about $100. My drives spun up, began their boot sequence and then never showed up on the computer. No clicking, buzzing, or any other indication of mechanical issues. I sent my drive to a business called, donor drives, who swapped out the controller board with one that did work and sent the drive back to me for around a hundred dollars. If it is a more serious problem, they'll ship it out to the data recovery service of your choice but those usually start around $300 and can go up to several thousand to recover data.Why 2 stars? I really do love these drives. They are portable, quick and nicely designed. If the controller board was fixed then I'd be happy to buy them again. As is, I'm recommending to friends and family to stay away from the WD Passport..

Two Terabytes of space gives you enough for an entire music collection.  But the tiny size is similar to an iPhone or FiiO DAP - just an inch wider.  And exceedingly thin (exact thickness is dependent on the storage space - see Amazon's specs).Note that the "Ultra" series is simply the 2013 release of WD's "My Passport" product - the non-Ultra version is simply the 2012 release that they still have in the warehouses.  As is usual, the new drives are smaller and faster than the old ones.I tried a whole afternoon of copying and the drive barely got warm, indicating that it is well designed to stay cool, despite the lack of a fan in such a small package.USB 3.0 gives it very fast transfer speed for PCs or laptops with USB 3.0 support.  For copying of many real world audio files, over several hours, the speed was clocked at 63, and the verification task was clocked at 96.Backup software is easy to find, so that is not a selling point for me, and terabytes of storage is for media, not for backup (where a small usb flash drive is plenty big).  But the password security software could be highly useful for someone who wants to store their financial information.The biggest factor in hard drive selection is still reliability, and it is far too early to judge that for this brand new series.  As usual, I will update this review with any further developments (such as a disk crash).Summary - this seems an excellent product for those looking for a huge amount of space for media in a small portable/mobile package..

I never use backup software so I won't comment on that.  I'm on a Mac and time machine does it for me but even when I was a Windows user I would just format the hard drive and use it to store my files. I also recommend doing just one partition as personally I think when I get into multiple partitions it gets confusing as to where I put what and then you will run out of space on one partition while having ample on the other just use folders.If you're a Mac user setting this hard drive up with your computer is super easy follow these steps.1. Plug in the the drive2. Open up disk utility found in your applications folder inside the utilities folder3. Next select the newly plugged in a drive and on the right-hand side you should see partition click on that.4. Then inside that screen on the partition layout drop-down choose how many partitions you'd like to set up. I generally go with one partition and just use folders to organize my files.5. Then on the right-hand side you can name the partitions and select the format. If you are transferring video files I highly recommend you choose Mac OS Extended (If you want to use it with Time Machine this is the choice you need to make) as it can handle files over 4GB. Sometimes it's good to make two partitions and one using "MS-DOS fat" or "ExFat" if you might be transferring files to and from a Windows machine. The reason is Windows machines and Macs can read and write to the "MS-DOS fat" format but your files will need to be under 4 GB each as that's the maximum file size it can handle.***6. Then click apply and your Mac will create all the partitions you wanted and you're good to go.*** The ExFat format is newer PC & Mac format and doesn't have a 4gb file size limit the "MS-DOS fat" or Fat32 does but not all cameras & digital devices can't read or write to it.Thanks for reading it is helpful please click the button thanks.UPDATE: I edited this to correct an error in my use of NTFS thanks to David Hobbs in the comments.

Luckily I had one, but if you don't you better get one before you start. The "instructions" are pictures (showing, the USB-SATA cable which is NOT included). When you go to install it throws an error about the inability to defrag. Doesn't say what it can't defrag. On-line tech support is a joke. The answer to every question is "call technical support." Except they are only open 9-6, M-F so don't expect to get help during the weekend. By the way, it takes many hours to do the migration, so if you need technical support you have to plan on being out of service most of a work day.So, having to work it out on my own, I discovered the Drive needs to be initialized and formatted. The defrag error was due to the fact that it could not defrag the drive because it was not formatted! Would have been nice to put that somewhere in the instructions, or maybe a format error instead of defrag. Once I had it formatted (a 2 hour process) the install ran perfectly (a 10 hour process). Shut down, installed the drive and powered it up (make sure you put it as SATA 0). Started up, the software automatically put the new drive as the C: boot drive, moved the old drive to another letter. The increase in performance is amazing (picture of a guy in an easy chair being blown away). If they had decent instructions and support I'd give it 5 stars in a heartbeat, but the process was way more annoying and frustrating than it had to be.Update 9-9-13 Brought it up to 4 stars based on feedback from others that I was too harsh on the product due to poor documentation and description. The drive itself is outstanding. This is without a doubt the one upgrade you can do that will really affect system performance. I do stand by my comments that proper documentation will significantly improve the user experience for those who are not professionals.Update 9-11-2013 Bought another one for my laptop. Worked with tech support. The installation instructions are WRONG. Instructions say install software, connect drive, run software. That WILL NOT WORK. First you have to connect, initialize and format the drive. Then install and run the software. By the way, Amazon shows a "list price" of $479.99 with a sell price of $369.99 so "You Save: $110.00 (23%)." Or you can buy it right from the factory for, yep, $369.99 so the savings is illusory at best, perhaps even a bit deceptive. Tiger has the exact same price. Worth every penny in my opinion, but certainly no great deal.[...].

Everything is much faster than HDD.  my Dell xps L502x hdd is not very slow but nothing compare to ssd.Con:  I had to pay for this Samsung 840 Evo when my old HDD worked without any problems.Other thoughts: This is my third SSD i replaced in 3 months.  2 are Samsung 840 Evo, one is Sandisk Ultra Plus.  all 3 of them are fast.  after replacing first one, it is difficult to use a slower pc.Installation: I did not use the CD/software that came with it.  I used Apricorn hard drive upgrade kit with usb 3.0 for all 3 of my SSD.  i do no like changing things when things worked.  3 easy steps: connect sata/usb3 cable to SSD and laptop, put Apricorn CD in drive, then started to transfer files.  Took 50 minutes to transfer 180GB of data plus 20 minutes to exchange SSD and HDD.  It was Dell xps L502x.  after booting pc, everything worked the same identically as my old hdd except of course much faster.  I do not know whether this SSD firmware is up to date or not since I did not use its CD software.  so far so good but if it needs firmware update, i will install its software.I wanted to thank you the reviewers who did the you tube for Apricorn Kit and exchanging hard drives.  They make it easy for me to do mine..

I purchased/installed two of these SSDs - one for my Laptop and one for my Desktop !!  They both work great - and the boot time and application start times are blazing fast !!  There is NOTHING else you can do to your PC to improve it's performance that comes anywhere near the improvement afforded by adding an SSD - and this one gets the best reviews of all of them !!However - their migration/imaging software utility assumes that you are totally &#34;replacing&#34; your current - single Hard disk with this single SSD !!  In fact - with both of my applications - I wanted to add this SSD as a boot / application drive - and maintain my existing Hard drive (which then automatically becomes a boot-a-ble backup boot drive in case of SSD failure) as a second drive.  I then keep my Music; Picture; and Video Libraries on the original hard drive and use the new SSD as the primary OS drive with all program files and the &#34;My Documents&#34; Library !!  THis approach is the best of both worlds - deploying the strengths of each device: fast boot and application startup for the SSD; and lots of inexpensive video; picture; and music storage on the hard drive.  However - while the Samsung migration software does allow you to select files not to migrate to the SSD during imaging - it is only on a &#34;file type&#34; basis.  And - it does a scan to find these files.  And - the scan does NOT find either the M4V or MP4 video files; or the m4a audio files !!  Well - that is my entire video and I-tunes libraries !!  Over 90 Gig !!  And there was no way to select these either.  What they should have included is a &#34;full Library&#34; select utility - or at a minimum - a full &#34;Folder&#34; to select for ommission from the migration.  SO - I had to copy all those files (about 2 hours) off to another drive - then erase them from my hard drive - then migrate the HD to the SSD - then copy those files back to the hard drive again !!  another 2 hours.  Come on Samsung!! - this is the most obvious application of your SSD device !!  Support it in your migration management software please !!!.

From Windows Experience Score 6.4 to 7.9 (max) in December 2013.  Incredible shutdown speed, and restart speed.  You might miss the login/logo screen, its that fast.  Today's SSD's are reliable, and will outlast normal hard drives.  Today's SSD's have been put through equivalent stress tests of over 20 gig a day for 20+ years and they have not worn out.  Their failure is more likely a result of a mechanical problem, of which a normal hard disk drives are far more susceptible to.To be honest, the difference in speed between this SSD, and other competitors is something that would be difficult for a human to discern.  What is the practical 50 mb/s difference in speed, when you are comparing against other 400-500 mb/s ssd's?  Maybe half a second on start-up?What makes this SSD from Samsung a great buy, is the included software, whether or not you have the desktop kit, that is included.  You get migration software, and a SD set-up and monitoring software.  This software exceeds the software provided by Intel for their SSD, and other manufacturers sometimes does not include any software, or provides for download a limited use software.If you are building a system, check out computer cases with built in 2.5 drive bays, and cases with built-in SSD mounts likeAntec Three Hundred Two Gaming Case, Black.  This case has two mounting platforms just for SSD's, one behind the motherboard, and the other on the floor of the case (SSDs will not require cooling).  This setup does not use any of the bays.  I purchased this case, and like it, but have not reviewed it yet.The Samsung Magician Software provides a user interface for the following tasks, which as as simple as clicking through.  This software makes the Samsung SSD the best buy, when compared to similarly priced SSD's, or even similar capacity SSD's.PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING.  Benchmark the SSD, and keep a history of benchmarks.  Compare them in graphs.  Not just this SSD, but any of the drives in your system.PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION.  Optimize Performance if your current OS does not use TRIMFIRMWARE UPDATESOS OPTIMIZATION.  Optimize Windows.  Easily choose three profiles; Maximum Performance, Maximum Capacity, or Maximum Reliability, and the Samsung Magician software will automatically make the associated settings on the SSD and in Windows.  You can also make your own customized profile.OVER PROVISIONING.  SSD need over-provisioning to maintain performance and reliability.  Some SSD's like Kingston will not need Over Provisioning, but will require that you have unused space for the benefits of Over Provisioning.  The Samsung Magician Software give you a recommended amount, and will unallocate the space for you.SECURE ERASE, if you ever needed to secure erase the SSD.  I'll be honest, I don't use it, but I believe that SSD's have a difference procedure than disc drives.RAPID MODE.  Samsung has a mode that can accelerate the SSD even more.  But I have read that this acceleration can only be used in certain circumstances.  It will require a gig of space to be enabledDATA SECURITY:  Data security can be enabled.This is an endurance test of Samsung 840 SSDs.  And, it is a conservative test.  [...].

The pro far out distance itself from ALL others.I almost kept the evo until Samsung told me the pro was 30% faster under heavy loads. I never saw that on any web site.

An ex-colleague was a fanatic about SSD drives, so I had to give it a try.I own a Lenovo T420 laptop computer with 6G of RAM running Windows 7-64 Professional.  My former drive was a Western Digital 1TB 5400 RPM 9.5mm drive.I didn't bother with the Samsung software at all.  I just did a system image to an external hard drive (a Windows 7 feature), installed this product, then restored from the image.My laptop boots up much more quickly and shuts down much more quickly.  All applications open noticeably faster.  Apple iTunes opens a LOT faster (I assume because it checks the music library at startup, which is a disk-intensive operation).My laptop now makes no noise that I can hear.  The drive is silent.I updated the BIOS in my computer and set up a hard drive password (which activates encryption in the drive).  I'm delighted that if my laptop is lost or stolen I now have no concerns about compromise of data.Additional notes:a)Laptop drives come in two heights, 7.0mm and 9.5mm.  For my model of laptop computer, I needed slightly different mounting rails for this Samsung 7.0mm drive than for my previous 9.5mm drive (not all laptops are like this--many or most use the same hardware for both heights of drive).  Be sure you have the right mounting hardware before you try to install the drive.b)I was also lucky that my old drive and new drive were the same capacity.  If you don't use the Samsung migration software and just use the system image capability of Windows, software such as "gparted" may also be necessary to resize partitions if your new drive has a larger capacity than your old.c)There may be advantages to installing the Samsung software to tune performance, especially if you plan to use more than 80% or so of the drive's capacity.  Not installing the software is not the right answer in every case..

The drive is very light and power efficient. Neither of these really matter for my implementation. Durability seems good as I had to install Windows and all my apps twice as I forgot to remove my UEFI from the second hard drive. The drive handled this well.Rather, I was after the raw speed of an SSD. I haven't benchmarked R/W speeds, you can find those all over the net. It is noticeably faster. Applications start from cold instantly. My form of benchmark involved starting windows, typing my login ( which is very consistent by now ) and letting steam finish starting up. I repeated this three times for consistency. My mechanical drive alone was  75 seconds. Mechanical plus the 24gb mSata SSD in Express Cache ( this is the stock configuration of this computer ) accomplished this in 56 seconds. The EVO SSD cold boots to Steam in 34 seconds.As for capacity, I have all my apps installed on it and it's really only half full. Overall I highly recommend this drive to anyone who thinks their computer is too slow. Chances are the processor is not your problem, just bloat and storage speed. If it doesn't work then buy and new computer and stuff this in it anyways and join us in 2014!.

That is unless you are very brave. LOL* It would be nice if transfer cable was provided or recommended type.Mistakes:1.  Biggest one Purchased Apricorn System Transfer system.Having read many of the reviews I made the mistake of thinking maybe another software would work better, so I purchased the USB 3.0 version of Apricorn system upgrade kit.  It comes with cable and software.  If you made the same mistake just put the software aside and use the cable with Samsung software.  If I were to do over would have just bought a cable like:  http://www.amazon.com/Patuoxun-SATA-Hard-Driver-Adapter/dp/B00C598VXW/ref=sr_1_153?s=pc&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1396198617&sr;=1-153&keywords;=USB+3.0+Sata+cable  which can be purchased for under $10 total.2. I did not back up system until I got to point that it looked like it would be necessary.Unless you are very brave create both an emergency disk and back up your entire system before attempting SSD Transfer.3.  I let lack of directions intimidate me with Samsung software.  Just install it and follow the prompts you will get through the install process.4.  Almost broke laptop case due to haste.  Should have watched more YouTube case openings for my system right before SSD installation.5.  I did not read all the reviews about disk partitioning close enough.  This is my first SSD HD and Laptop disk installation ever so I probably should have learned from others advice more.  Plus I have found in the past that reading reviews you get a better feeling for the product.  I knew I wanted the Samsung SSD, just didn't know about the install on my system.6.  Lastly I have a UPS Unit that I could have used but did not.  The software says that once transfer starts not to turn off computer for any reason.  What if my power were to fail, I would have been writing what a fool I was not to use my UPS.  I was just lucky on this one.  Better to avoid problems if at all possible.7.  Back to partitioning.  When I did my second partition which is used for system recovery on my system I added a few gigs just in case and am glad that I did.  I read something about the last partition being used when you allocate more memory to drive performance.  I have much to learn about this drive, SSD drive installations and using an SSD drive all together.8.  3/31/14  Almost forgot when doing the data migration I think you want to be sure to set your size on any secondary partitions to be created on your SSD drive.  This is done by left clicking on the destination drive moving the size bar.  Play with it a bit to see what I am talking about.  Do this before you start your system transfer.  I used 20 GB for my D: partition which is the HP system recovery partition.  You can probably get partitioning software to adjust your partition without losing data, but why not get it right the first time. It looked to me like if I had not adjusted the partition that the software would have made my partition would have been with no extra room for any additions to the system recovery drive D:, but not sure.Okay with all that said I really like the Samsung drive.  I would buy it again, and I wish you the best with your installation.  Don't rush it and I am sure all will go fine..

Since I intended to add my first SSD, I wanted to take advantage of an optimum configuration. This meant switching from IDE to the more advanced AHCI mode. There is a registry hack for doing this without a re-install, but a clean re-installment promised the fewest issues.When you  do a re-install, you must change the boot-order for your computer at startup. I mention this because it caused me some real issues, later.Installing the drive, I anticipated a painless "Plug n' Play" experience. Nope.Right from the start, there were issues. First, my new SSD drive was somehow "welded" to my Asus DVD drive. In My Computer they showed up as something like D:Asus DVD:F: Samsung 120Gb. I jotted down the exact prompt but managed to lose it. Sorry.I puzzled over what had gone wrong, Then I remembered that I had not changed my boot order back to Hard Drive. Even after restoring the boot order it took a restart to get back my DVD drive, on it's own.I looked and looked, but could not find my new drive listed in My Computer. Again, what had gone wrong? I even considered that I had received a unit that was DOA, but the odds favored some kind of operator error. Then I had a last minute thought; what if the drive requires formatting or partitioning? I opened Disc Management and sure enough, there was my drive. I formatted it NTFS. That did the trick. Because Samsung's instructions are so lousy, I subtract one star. The drive appears to work great, though I haven't put it through it's paces, yet. But, the Samsung instruction booklet is actually a folded "road map" of ambiguous drawings and not a word of explanatory text. None. Picture a comic book, without the balloon captions. The software comes in two forms. Magician for drive settings and configuration, and Migration (I think that's what it's called), for transferring your OS and files to the SSD. I only installed the Magician portion which seemed mildly useful.Starting over, I would not even use the software disc but instead have Device Manager find the necessary driver, which is just what seemed to do the trick.My original boot order was C: Hard Drive and D: DVD Drive. After installing the unit and formatting, I ended up with two new partitions. E: Containing about 70.3 Mb out of 99.9 Mb available and a second partition called F: Containing 111 Gb of 111 Gb available.I assume the first drive (E:) is some kind of MBR or boot-record for the SSD drive proper. I didn't expect to see it and it spoils the logical progression of my drives, (It  should have been C: D: E: Right?). Well, I can live with it.One more issue to deal with. I often use my "right-click" menu to send files to my drives. But, when I right-clicked a file the Send To box did NOT list my new drive. After some time at Google, I found a simple hack that does the trick. In your Search Box type:shell:sendto and then Enter. A menu box opens showing those items already in the Send To field. Then you just  "drag and drop" the object you want (In my case, the F: drive) to the Send To menu box, and it will now display when Send To is active. You can also edit this box to remove unwanted options. All good to know.Well, my installation was not quick or painless, but I'm hoping my struggles will help others to avoid some of my pitfalls.A quick update: It's the next day now and I have run a performance check. The Magician software has a test routine that allows you to measure the drives performance on your own machine.Here are my values. Keep in mind that maximum performance values are in parenthesis.Sequential read: 471Mb (540)  Sequential write: 536Mb (410)Random reads I/O operations: 57,995 (94,000)  Random writes I/O operations: 49,143 (35,000)The test is fast, about one minute. Some of my values were better than projected maximums. Not sure what to make of that, except that performance is in the range of other SSDs. A good sign.Two other items I neglected to mention before. The Samsung drive "wants" to be installed at your first SATA port, usually called SATA 0 rather than 1. I installed the SSD at SATA 6 port 0, and my Seagate HD at SATA 6 port 1. Finally, I notice that I get a security prompt (UAC) for the Magician software at startup. If I cannot disable it with CCleaner, I will remove the program altogether..

(That includes the time it takes to go through the BIOS boot processes.)  From power off to booted up and ready to go in 30 seconds!  Starting Microsoft Outlook used to be a process where I waited several minutes before I could actually start using Outlook.  It might start the shell of the application, but that was a far cry from it being ready to use.  It didn't matter how much RAM, or how fast a CPU I had.  After installing this drive, Outlook starts in seconds, and is useable right away.  It's the same for most applications that I once waited on every time I opened them.If you work in IT, and you support laptop users, you'll know what I mean when I say they can be demanding, and very vocal, about their system performance.  If you have a bunch laptops that are a year or two old, that are starting to show flagging performance, consider upgrading their system drives with one of these before seeking a replacement.  In my case, the results were nothing short of extraordinary!Samsung also provides a nice app to help users migrate their OS and applications from their old drive to the new SSD.

I have always struggled getting good signal propagation throughout the unit, about 1000 square feet total area. Even mobile phone service has been a problem, until very recently when I switched to T-mobile I couldn't have a cell conversation unless I stood at one of our windows.I had solved the propagation issue for a while by adding an extension cable to my router's antenna. I moved it into a different wall and with a reflector, this more or less allowed decent connectivity throughout the unit until neighbors started to use stronger routers a couple of weeks ago. I noticed that suddenly we were getting disconnects from any device that we tried, but only on one side of the house. A wifi analysis app showed me that either somebody upgraded a router and it was extremely powerful, or he fielded an extender and between his two signals it was drowning mine.Installing this device was pretty painless. I had to do the manual setup, but that's because Verizon never enabled the one-button feature in my particular router. All I did was connect to the extender with a Kindle Fire HDX, logged into it, gave it the password for my access point and 30 seconds later I was done. It only took me two tries to find a spot in the house that would fix the weak signals issue.The device itself is a neat little plastic doodad, no bigger than a plug-in air freshener. If your router has a one-button setup feature, you should be able to get it up and running within a minute of opening the box. The packaging itself is very nice, the kind of packaging you would expect from an Apple device (the manual is in a folder that is identical to how iPhone manuals are bundled).Documentation is fine, but that's from just making it into the first two steps. The device also included an ethernet patch cord, which was a nice touch ,and a small-format CD, I don't know what would happen if the user needs the CD and his drive isn't compatible with that kind of CD.I will revise this review once I have a chance to hit it hard from the weaker sides of the house. My initial testing showed videos that used to stutter are now playing smoothly.UPDATE (7/16/2014): The device decided to stop working within a day of my original review, couldn't reach it even through the ethernet port, hard reset didn't work at all.I assumed it was a defective unit, so I exchanged it. The replacement unit lasted a couple of days longer before it started giving us grief again and I have asked for a refund.My main motivation for attempting to use this device? I am forced to use the router specified by Verizon FIOS since the cable boxes rely on it through the MoCa port, which to me is idiotic (or a con to keep us using their routers). My condo has metal studs and it wrecks hell on any kind of signal propagation, I actually had to relocate the original antenna with an extension cable just so I could get minimum coverage within the house. Verizon was too happy to advertise that I could upgrade to a newer router for $100, which is ridiculous.I was really hoping that this doodad would do the trick, but after two defective units I decided to move on.Yesterday I plugged a TP-LINK TL-WDR4300 into my FIOS router and turned off the radio in the FIOS router. Now I have excellent coverage in my house and it still cost me $33 less than going with the Verizon device. Ironically, the web UI on the WDR4300 is basically identical to the one on the WA850RE so I felt right at home configuring the new device..

This is done with speed test on a mobile app. Test with laptop is better but not even close to 12.xxx mb down. Also the test is done 2 to 3 ft next to the TP-Link.4- My PS4 looks like now picks up this TP-Link instead the main router! maybe is because is closer than the main router. Now the connection speed down like crazy and I got connection drop many times during game play. Also movie streaming is very logging! I got better connection with less signal main router than connected to a full signal TP-Link.My sum up, this wifi ranger extender don&#8217;t work well at all. Yes I got more signal but the speed got drop like crazy and connection continually bounce on and off. Since is cheap, no brother ask for refund! I just throws it in trash!My internet provider is Verizon Fios and with Verizon new version MI424WR router, speed is 50 down/25 up. And I done all my networking at my work and home, so I can say I am very good at this thing! I don&#8217;t think I did anything wrong with the setup. I have to say, the easy up is very easy!

If I connected to this device wirelessly, it would not finish and save the settings.  I had to reset to reconnect to it.  If I connected with the provided UTP cable, it saved the settings but would not connect to the wireless network.Update.  I finally got it to connect to my router and it seems to be working well.  Still, there's an issue with the web interface.  After the AP is set up, further attempts to use the setup screen caused my browser to attempt to connect to http:\\tplinkextender.net - which takes you to a screen inviting you to purchase the domain.  I checked my router for the extender's IP address and used that to connect to it.  Although only an inconvenience to me, this could be a show stopper for other folks.It appears that any issue which would cause the connection to fail will cause the quick setup to enter an apparently endless loop.  It never finishes the setup and doesn't tell the user why it failed.  This only happens in wireless setup.  When connected via UTP, the setup completes when one presses the &lt;finish> button.  The failure to connect from this screen doesn't generate any kind of error message, it just fails.  Knowing *why* the connection repeatedly failed would have enabled me to quickly diagnose and resolve the problem (a security issue).Another problem was that the AP appears to need AdobeFlash for the login screen.  I would have used my Kindle HDX to setup the AP, but I couldn't log in.  No login screen ever appeared.

Set it up using WPS (click a button on your router, hit the button on this) or manually via a cat5 cable (not included).  It then will extend your network and help with network dropouts and dead spots in your wifi.  It doesn't support the newest wireless-ac standard, but only a few extenders do, and they are still quite expensive.  This will handle  99% off the speed most people need (some routers will do 450mbps, but most of the extenders only do 300mbps, if you are out of range anyways, 300mpbs is much better than nothing, and will probably not notice it in practice).So that all is well and good, what are my complaints with it?* Can only extend one wifi network.  If you router does a guest and a private network, you have to pick which one you can extend, cannot do both.* Cannot feed the extender with an ethernet cable from your router.  It appears the only use for the ethernet port is to use it for a gaming console/comptuer that doesn't have wifi, so you can hard wire it.  I would love to be able to use the ethernet port to extend the network, this means the traffic between this extender and the wifi router would be not adding to the congestion, it also lets you move this farther away instead of having to overlap with your existing wifi.It's a good, small, simple extender that for the price is pretty much a no brainer if you have dead spots.

Unfortunately, the IP address range may not match up with your home network nor will your DNS server addresses.  I figured this out when my devices would connect but I couldn't go anywhere on the internet by URL.The Fix:1) You'll need to assign the extender a static IP address, subnet mask, and gateway that is part of your home network's range.2) You'll need to disable DHCP on your extender otherwise it'll hand out incorrect IP addresses, gateway IPs, and DNS information..

I called the cable company and I was prepared to pay them to provide a solution that gave my entire house Wi-Fi. The cable company (Optimum) said they don't do that, "All they provide is an Internet connection and a Wi-Fi router." They were nice enough and offered me an "upgraded" router free of change with my service; they claimed that their Sagemcom Router would give better range than my Netgear, but ultimately it provided the same exact range (and perhaps a bit less).So I was speaking to a friend who said he had a local high end audio/visual company come in that installed a Wi-Fi antenna in his attic that gave the entire house Wi-Fi, but he spent $1000 to do it! For that price I told my kids that they're just gonna have to go to the rooms with Wi-Fi if they want Wi-Fi. But that solution wasn't practical because the kids would more often than not just use their cellular data instead of moving to the room with Wi-Fi, and that, friends and neighbors, can end up costing more than a lease for a Cadillac if they go over their wireless data limit on a regular basis. Yes, I know you can have the cellular company shut their data down when it gets to a certain limit, but that would make for less than harmonious relations around the house.So I called the cable company one more time and asked if there were any alternatives to a $1000 solution, and the guy on the phone gasped. He said, "$1000?!? Just go to an electronics store and get a range expander for $50 or less." Well, color me nave, but where has this TP-LINK TL-WA850RE 300Mbps Universal Wi-Fi Range Extender been all my life?!  (And why didn't they tell me that last time?)The TP-LINK arrived from Amazon, and within 15 minutes of accepting the package from UPS, almost my entire house now has Wi-Fi. Out of the box, FIRST you just plug the thing in in the same room as your router. Wait for the LED display on the front of the TP-LINK to indicate that it is receiving a wireless signal, then just hold the WPS button on your router down for 5 seconds, then within a minute or two press the WPS button on the TP link, and voil&agrave;! Once connected, SECOND, move it to the room farthest away from the router that still gets a decent signal from the router; for me it was upstairs in one of the rooms caddy corner to the room with the router below; the result was a rebroadcast of Wi-Fi service to the entire house! Just be sure that the room that you relocate the TP-LINK to shows AT LEAST 3 bars of signal strength. MY TP-LINK is receiving 3 bars of signal strength but interestingly it is broadcasting 5 bars of strength according to most of the devices connected to it.There's no need select a different W-Fi network on any of your devices or re-enter a Wi-Fi passkey; as long as the device you're connecting was already connected to your original router, the device will simply find the re-broadcast signal from the TP-LINK and automatically connect.So try this inexpensive option before you pay some outrageous price for a custom Wi-Fi service install..

It may be a router compatibility issue, but I would not count on WPS working.That said, once the manual setup was complete, I've had flawless performance and excellent signal strength. That is surprising to me because the wall plug unit does not look like it would have an ideal antenna. The ethernet port works great for an ethernet bound media center.

If it worked like it said, I would have loved it.I started out trying to use the simple setup method.  It would not connect to my Frontier DSL wireless router.  So, I plugged it into my computer for the less simple setup.  At least the control page came right up on my browser.  That was cool.When I got to the step to scan for wireless networks, it found my neighbors, but not my wi-fi.  Meanwhile, my iPhone was connected to my local wi-fi with a strong signal (it was only 10 feet away).  I tried multiple times to rescan for available networks, to no avail.  So, I decided to choose manual SSID/MAC entry.  I took a photo of the tag on the bottom of my router so I had the numbers available, and typed them in.  After entering it all, it seemed happy until I clicked Finish.  Then I saw that it was not connected.  Out of frustration, I decided to try for a scan of available networks.  This time it found my network, with a strong signal.  Why not before?  Much better signal than my neighbors (I could see 4 neighbor signals).  I completed the setup, and the LED display on the unit indicated a strong signal incoming, and that everything was working.Now that it was connecting, I wanted to try to use it in our exercise room for our TV, which has functions that can use the internet.  Interestingly enough, two versions of my SSID showed up:  one with a stronger signal than the other.  I selected the stronger one (as I assumed that was the extender plugged in right here), and could not connect.  Just to be fair, I can't connect to the main router, either.  I don't know if this is a problem with the Samsung TV (brand new) or the Frontier DSL router by Netgear (Model B90), also brand new.Sigh.  OK, let's check the signal on my iPhone.  Oops, strong signal, not connected!  I attempted to make it connect several times with no effect. I got the message "unable to connect."  So, I unplugged the extender to see if I could connect to the DSL router.  Nope.  I had to reset the DSL router and enter Airplane Mode (and back) before I could get reconnected.On the iPhone, it only showed one version of my SSID, not two as on the TV.  I believe the DSL router is on one channel, and the extender selects a different channel.Maybe something is not happy with my DSL router, and maybe my brand new TV is not connecting to the network correctly.  But one thing is for sure, the extender did not work on my iPhone or on the TV, and seemed to mess up the other router as well as the iPhone.Finally, when will they stop creating manuals with tiny text you need a magnifying glass to read?All in all, I am not a happy camper.UPDATE:  Since I had some issues with the Frontier wireless, such as having to reboot it once a day or so, I decided to set up my own wi-fi router, also from TP-LINK.  I had used this prior to my move.  Also included was a strong firewall appliance between the DSL modem and the TP-LINK wireless router.  It worked perfectly, so I shut off the wireless function of the Frontier unit.  Now the TV connects just fine, as do the iThingies.I then went to the TV room, and plugged in the range extender.  It connected just fine.  At first, my iPhone was OK.  I then turned on the TV, and it could not connect.  I reset and retried the TV, no luck.  I pulled out my iPhone and noticed it was no longer connected, and was spinning.  I turned off wi-fi, waited, turned it back on.  Still spinning.I unplugged the extender.  The TV then connected.  I had to turn wi-fi off and back on to get the iPhone to connect.So, while there was a great improvement when using a TP-LINK wi-fi router, I still could not make the Range Extender work correctly (although it appears to connect to the main router just fine).I am waiting for some help from their tech support:  maybe they can figure it out..

The additional benefit is that I can use it at home like a range extender.The only problem is I do not have a physical access to the router, so i asked several for answers in the forum, and also found one in the answer section that said you cannot use it like a range extender in a hotel.I took a chance and I ordered this.The setup is very easy,Step1- power on the tp extenderstep2 connect it through your wifistep3: type default passwordStep4: Login into the tpextender website that is given in the instruction manual, or type in the ip address.Step5: enter the default passwordStep6: Follow the quick setup process, that scans the network and locates the wireless network you want to connect, then you can either mirror the network that just looks like the same network but range is greatly increased or you can give a separate name and password.So, you can use it for vonage to connect your phone and then connect the fax machine to it, You can use it to make your non wifi printer to wifi printer.You can use it in a hotel  to connect your chrome.You can use it in your car and connect google chrome to stream movies to you car video, or share a media drive in your won car network.The instrument is very travel friendly, I am very happy so far.

I set up one network with a weak password and basic encryption, for visiting Guests. The other network uses a strong password and strong encryption, for my family's use. This TP-LINK TL-WA850RE range extender can only extend the range of one network; I used it to extend the range of my &#34;family_network&#34;. During setup, I used an option to name the extended network with a different name, &#34;family_network_extended&#34;, so that I could easily measure or connect to either network, without confusion.This product does what it promises; it substantially boosts signal strength. I placed it in a location BETWEEN my router and an area of the house where the signal strength is relatively low. Using a free signal strength metering app (&#34;WiFi Analyzer&#34;) on my Kindle HD, I measured the signal strength at distant points, further away from the router, for both networks.  In one location, with intervening walls between the range extender and the Kindle, the signal improved from -72 dBm to -48 dBm. In a second &#34;line of sight&#34; location, with no obstructions between the Kindle and the range extender, the signal strength increased from -63 dBm to -33 dBm. A signal strength of 0 to -60 is very good.You must place the range extender in a location with decent signal strength, or it may be unable to boost it enough to help you. It has its own basic meter that can help to to find an acceptable location.There are two approaches to setup; both are easy if you have a basic understanding of your WiFi network - and you know your network logon password. I preferred the second method. Read the setup instructions carefully, at least once, then start your setup. If you are someone who &#34;never reads the manual,&#34; don't buy this product because you can't set it up without reading and following the instructions.This range extender is small enough to carry when you travel, and could help to improve your access to the internet by boosting a WiFi signal that's just barely acceptable - in a hotel or a friend's home. To do that, you'll need to reset it and re-program it, using a paper clip..

Fundamentally it is well built, looks pretty cool, and has some of the more powerful hardware you can get your hands on these days.  That&#8217;s a good combination for success. However, it falls short.The real issue is Netgear&#8217;s firmware (the software that runs it). It is a little clunky, as many consumer routers are, but the bigger issue is that it is SLOW. Trying to configure the router is amazingly painful. It can take minutes, and a number of retrys, to get the ting to load a page. So you have to be extremely patient any time you want to make a change. I suppose this would be ok if you were just going to use it as is, out of box, but if you want to actually set it up in the way you wish, it is just a chore.It does seem to be more responsive if you disconnect the WAN port, so there is, sort of, a solution. But it is still laggy and the real issue is that you don&#8217;t want to have to take down your Internet connection just to configure your router.That said, it seems to do its job actually routing fine. It passes traffic like it should; I don&#8217;t see any increase in ping times, and speed tests are fast. So it does perform the primary function of routing without issues that I&#8217;ve been able to find so far, though I&#8217;ve not had it long.However the slow admin interface is enough that I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it. When you are spending this much you can, and should, get a product that works well in all respects. So I&#8217;d look elsewhere, and indeed I am..

Now it is too late, and i am depressed at wasting so much of my hard earned money to buy a product that does not work at all as intended.From the beginning i was having problems with connectivity and pocket clotting. I have messed around with the settings but sadly the entire thing just didn't want to work correctly. I have dismissed the issues for a while because it was running decently, but i really should have returned it day 1 of my problems.This model has beam forming which should connect to mobile devices and such to increase signal strength. This does indeed work and i was pleased with this function, as my mobile wi-fi increased SLIGHTLY. I was just hyped up for this product and dismissed all of the problems and everything else that went wrong / worked only 1/2 as advertised.The bandwidth advertised does its job somewhat well, and it can keep quite a fiew devices working. Problem is that the packet management for this is TERRIBLE. I found that enabling any of the multimedia / QoS settings, set up with all the correct ports as high priority traffic MADE THE POCKET CLOTTING WORSE THAN BEFORE!One of the other things this is supposed to do is to allow multimedia to come through faster. This is over exaggerated on this product once you turn the multimedia feature on. If i have ANY sort of downstream (be it video or w/e) it will push all your packets off the cable completely.I am vastly hurt by the financial hit of buying this device. I am a full time student and a part time worker, with around $600-$1000 in my bank at all times for some dark hours. If you are in my situation DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... It does not do what it is advertised to do. I thought i was buying a good multimedia / gaming router, and i got a crappy 200$ scrap of metal that &#34;looks good and has a cool name&#34;.It depresses me that such an expensive product can be this bad. I wish that i could get my money back to have another try, but i waited too long, and companies don't care about this anyway. They got my money already. good for them...PS: if you are looking for a good gaming router get this one like D-Link Wireless AC Gaming Router. I do not have it yet but maybe in a view months i can get it when i get enough extra savings to afford one. They are cheaper then the netgear router (with less bandwidth but you will still be fine with many devices) and it is a heaven for gamers. It also has a detailed analysis of the network and how much each device uses the network. I had a chance to play with one because my uncle got one.

Constant fast connection and no problems with any of the multiple devices I use on the network.Updated 3/122014I removed 1 star from my rating due to recent issues I experienced with this router. After setting up QOS for my VOIP phone I suddenly started experiencing Internet speed slowdowns while surfing and stuttering on my VOIP apps. I have 57/12Mbps download / upload speeds from ISP. These speeds would drop to 0.23/1 Mbps for 20 to 30 seconds several times a day before slowly improving and returning to normal. During these times VOIP was barely useable. I deleted all my QOS rules and disabled upstresm / downstream QOS and the freezing / stuttering / slowdowns went away. There are other reports of QOS problems with this router so I would recommend avoiding this router until firmware update resolves this if you need QOS.Unfortunately, above did not solve the problem as I am still experiencing slowdowns / freezes with this router. In current state this router is not useable as I use it in my home office for business. Prior to the N1900 I used a Netgear N750 and did not experience any of these problems. Removing another star and looking for another router.After doing some web research and finding a number of people experiencing same issues I reset the router to factory default and re-entered all my router settings like wifi info etc. This seems to have fixed the problem. It appears that you need to reset the router to factory default after updating the firmware otherwise you may experience slowdowns and intermittent behavior. Annoying but at least router works now. Will update if problem re-appears. Incidentally, you reset the router by using paper clip to push reset button on back of router for 10 plus seconds.4/8/2014 Update: I experience wireless dropouts every 2 - 3 weeks where Wi-Fi drops all Wi-Fi devices and the only way to re-establish connection is to re-boot the router.

It cant be done even per Netgear support. Linksys had it. Per Netgear none of their consumer class routers offer it after calling them to verify. I wish I knew before purchase.-Firmware is buggy IMO. Garbled text on device names in attached list following a reboot. Inability to delete devices from list. Does not show lease time. All of these features are present in the Linksys.-Doesn't play as well with Netgear's own products the 3000RP Extender and 40004 WI-FI gaming adaptor. Requires reboots when changing devices. Linksys had none of these problems.I plan to keep this router as I got it on sale for 20% off the market price (including Amazon's current) at a competing retailer and the price/value was perceived as a no brainer. Its less of a no brainer given the problems cited above but I will keep it due to its faster speed.

It took 2 hours for me and Netgear to figure out why a fully configured router was losing internet access.  So, the initial setup takes less than 10 minutes if at all.  I have to give 5 stars to Netegar.  Now the problem I faced - The router is physically placed near the home theater equipment I can connect a lot of devices using hard wire method.  One of the devices turned out to be culprit for my connection woes - and that device is Comcast's HD cable box.  When connected (either directly to the router or through a Gigabit network switch which in turn connected to the router), the default IP address would change from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.100.1, thereby causing all devices to lose connection.  Netgear and I spent time trying to pinpoint the problem and eliminating one device after the other.  We then entered in the browser the auto-modified ip address and it was populating a window showing "Pace Micro Plc" username and password.  Anyway, to cut short the story, we removed Comcast box from connecting directly to the router or to the switch and instead connected to the back of another device which has LAN ports.  Problem solved. Netgear customer support from Philippines is simply superb.  They are patient, pleasant, very courteous, and most importantly, they know their stuff and even if they don't, they will get the answer quickly for you.  And when they say, they will call - they surely will.Connectivity: Once the problem mentioned above was resolved, everything else was a breeze.  The router interface page is great.  I put the primary 5 and 2.1 is hidden mode which is working with all my devices.  The guest accounts are visible.  The devices are connected without a drop in connection, granted this has only been a day since I fired up the device and more updates will follow in the months to come.  At this point, I don't have any AC devices. Only N devices and they all work fine. I have at least several devices connected to it.Signal Strength: Strong signals anywhere in the home.  Speeds are very good no matter where I am in the home.  I heard that 5 ghz signal weakens the farther the distance and I experienced that problem with my Cisco EA4500 but this one seems to beam the 5 ghz signals to the far end of the world and perhaps other planets too (if the antennas are any bigger).  5 stars here. Thanks to mega-sized antennas.Features: QoS automatically identified my streaming databases on multiple devices and is now configured.  No buffering issues in the limited testing I have done.  Other standard set of features you would expect in a router are all there.  One annoyance is the bright LED lights that a lot of people complained about.  I spoke with Netgear and there is no way to disable them. I used, like others, black electrical insulation tape to cover them. So much for spending $200 and taping the damn thing.  I am not impressed with it.  But, I am not reducing any stars for this and am hoping that Netgear will add this feature in the next firmware. Between Asus and this one, I went with Netgear because it has been in industry building networking products only.  Asus on the other hand has its finger in every pie you can possibly imagine so I am not sure that their heart is focused solely on building the best networking products.  In addition, I've read that Asus does only downstream internet speed optimization where as R7000 does upstream as well as downstream but if you don't game this might not make a lot of difference I suppose. See this:[...]Footprint: Contrary to a lot of people citing it to be huge and stuff, I don't find it any larger than other standard routers I have seen.  Yes, with those lights it can be in your face though.  Yes, it is a tad bit bigger than others but I don't care so long as it performs well.Conclusion: I will be adding a couple of laptops the AC network cards and will report the speeds, signal strength and other attributes at that time.

It did most of the leg work for me. I really like the push button on/off switch on the back as I keep my router off when not in use(makes it convenient). It has nice information lights on top-front and low profile even though it's pretty big. The net gear genie provides easy to use options and I like the network map showing each of my devices.

Needless to say last night I learned that porn is stronger than the Nighthawk.Parental Control Problems:1. If you set the router on the highest setting for network protection it filters porn, however it also filters out pretty much anything but first grade friendly material. A no-go for a house with a teenager who has reports to do for school and needs internet access.2. In the Parental Control interface you can setup strict browsing for the family and an override account for those who don't need or want it, but using 'custom' settings is frustrating and seems to be hit and miss for porn specifically.3. In the Parental Control settings you can add up to 25 sites you want blocked. That's it - and it's not enough for all trash on the internet!4. In the Genie dashboard under Advanced - Security you can add keywords and domains (yuck dot com, dot net...) to block. When those are set, if a user attempts to go there they get a black screen with red stripes that says 'Firewall Blocked' user.5. Removing a 'keyword' is a joke too! You have to clear the list and start over, as it won't let you delete just one word like 'porn' to eliminate all sites with that keyword in the title from opening.You can set things up so that the administrator gets emailed every time one of the blocked sites gets a 'knock, knock' by a user on your network. Unfortunately, this too has a limited number of sites and/or keywords that can be added, and it's just not enough for the price you pay for this router!The speed and stability is great, but I hate that with this expensive piece of equipment and user-interface that seems to be so helpful - these limitations are put on the device.I didn't buy this router to limit porn, but it is one of the things I like to do on my home network. I'm not a prude, but I should be able to surf securely if that's part of what's promised at a premium price.Oh, and the way I found this out was that I periodically go onto a browser like Bing or Google and type in random words and phrases to see what shows up. When it's something related to porn and I know I have the filter set, I click to make sure they are blocked. Last night, it wasn't and I spent nearly 3 hours learning the limitations of the NETGEAR Genie software.Maybe this is something that can be addressed by the NETGEAR Team in an update? It will definitely have to be improved upon to be considered a safe router for households who are concerned with Parental Controls,  and I would not recommend this router for this reason.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is a huge, pricey wireless router which is worth every penny if you're living in a big home, have multiple devices all wanting WiFi, want to be able to take command of your network in darn near every way possible or 'all of the above'.WHY I CHOSE THIS WIRELESS ROUTER...I purchased this router with some trepidation due to the high sticker price. It's twice as expensive as the most expensive one I've previously purchased and also twice as big.  Despite these things, I was looking for a router to replace myBelkin N750 Wireless DB Dual-Band Gigabit N+ Router With High Speed HD Streaming & USB (F9K1103), which while OK, was struggling to keep up with the growing WiFi demands of my family.With 15 wireless devices used on the network (laptops, desktops, streaming devices, smartphones, gaming systems, etc...), if everyone was connected, we all experienced signal drop offs. When streaming video it was not uncommon to get lagging connections and/or encounter buffering issues.After reading a bit about higher end routers, I decided to get a simultaneous dual band router. This one works well as you can set the (QoS - Quality of Service) to uploads (for gaming) or to downloads (for streaming). These two things opened up a whole new level of enjoyment in this cord cutter household!Having written a book on cord cutting:Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV, and using myRoku 3 Streaming Media Player,Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media PlayerandApple TV MD199LL/Ato supplement my over air HD TV network programming, I know the importance of a solid WiFi network and this NETGEAR Nighthawk beautifully gets the job done. Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video and Hulu Plus all load more quickly and offer great picture quality and stability.In addition to this router's awesome performance and range, this NETGEAR product has a fantastic software utility suite (for both PC and MAC) with free iOS and Android apps. The software is easy to use and highly customizable.  I love the Parental Controls, which can be set for the whole network, or just for specific devices.THE PROS:+ Exceptional range.+ Outstanding speed (*more than doubled my download speed from 33Mbps to 68Mbps) with simultaneous dual band (2.5Ghz and 5Ghz).+ Excellent security settings, which are setup for you at installation. **NOT true - see update!***+ Whisper quiet.+ Lights can be turned OFF in NETGEAR Genie (Settings - Advanced - LED Control Settings) or have them blink, or remain solid - your choice!+ QoS settings make customizing your network a breeze for the things you do most whether they are gaming or streaming; by group or per device.+ Can set up a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to access your network from anywhere.+ Lots of options for tweaking the setup, if you desire it.+ READYSHARE for printers or for network storage and back-up is a great feature.+ Guest network setup is optional.+ At a glance access to all the devices on your network by app or PC with NETGEAR Genie software.+Setup Wizard in 'Advanced' area of NETGEAR Genie works to effortlessly get you online.+ You can set up FTP storage.+ DLNA enabled for media server functionality; including iTunes library.+ USB 3.0 port for connecting external storage or media server.+ Ability to block specific sites or sites by keyword, in addition to Parental Control settings which are highly customizable.+ Ability to block services on a schedule.+ Ability to have WiFi turn off during scheduled times during the day or by entire days of the week.+ Ability to set up email alerts when devices on the network attempt to connect to specific sites.+ Ability to enable wireless repeater function.+ Ability to see traffic loads (upload/download) on your network.+ The router can be hung on a wall or sit on a desktop.+ Very cool to the touch, with excellent ventilation on the sides of the device.+ You can set password recovery questions when you reset your password from the default 'password' at start up.THE CONS:- It's HUGE, and the 'wingspan' with the three antennas attached makes it about the same footprint as a 15" laptop. (I have mine hanging on the wall with the cables coming out the top for easy access.)- Initial setup even with NETGEAR Genie did not go smoothly for me, and I'm an intermediate to advanced user. Small tweaks here and there in the NETGEAR Genie got all of my devices to play well together eventually though.- The price is hefty compared to other wireless routers for home use, but its features and speed are impressive.THINGS TO NOTE...Firmware updates must be made out of the box; Advanced - Administration - Router Updates and then 'Apply'. (You can get the latest prior to setting up your router and install it by finding the file on your computer, or let the router connect and obtain it.)There's an iOS app called 'Net Analyzer Lite' that I found to be very useful in identifying some of my devices by MAC address. This in addition to the NETGEAR Genie app are both free, and well worth the downloads.This is an impressive package both in terms of hardware and software. I'm very pleased with this purchase and I highly recommend it to those who want a feature-packed router with top notch speed and security settings. I think it would be ideal for a small business, multi-level or large home, or any sized home with lots of devices (10+) who are all competing for bandwidth.Highly recommend this one if you can afford it!UPDATE: 5/11/14 - I'm loving this router! Netflix flies through shows using 5Ghz and no buffering with a Roku 3. I can download an album to the Amazon Cloud in about 15 seconds and every web browser: Chrome, IE, Opera, Safari... loads pages faster. I'll be hooking up a Seagate USB 3.0 external drive with movies to use the DLNA feature and will update this review after that use.Overall, I can't say enough good things about this purchase.UPDATE: 5/17/14 - That 'love' was short lived and the 5 star rating was dropped to a '2' star based upon porn getting through and the limited ability to add blocked sites or keywords for added security. Paying this much for a router - it should have solid security as well as speed..

Devices discovered, do you want to allow or block? Simple. Even worked after the simple firmware upgrade!

At first all seemed pretty good. I got noticeably better WiFi coverage, speed and range throughout my home. The device is large and impressive looking and has a fantastic set of display lights. The configuration settings were fairly straight forward also.That is where the good ends though. The QOS setup was far less configurable than I'd like it to be. Not only that, but the method in which it is implemented I found to be fairly confusing compared to my previous router.Even after learning the ropes in how to configure QOS, it never seemed to make much of a different. As soon as any device started any type of sizeable upload or download, my ping latency in games such as BF4 went from 20-40ms to 500+ms and were unplayable. It also seemed to struggle with multiple machines trying to play online at the same time, which was never the case with my prior router.Another very strange problem that didn't exist prior began to exhibit as soon as I attached this router in place of my prior. Many of my machines connected to the router would frequently have their Network Discovery service disabled for no apparent reason that I could figure out. As soon as I reinstalled my prior router, the problem disappeared. So the Nighthawk certainly seemed to be playing a part in the problem.I've owned Linksys, D-Link and Netgear routers in my past. I've ended up returning every Netgear so far for strange problems such as those I endured with this device. D-Link has been the most stable and reliable devices for me overall.In the end I returned the device for refund. I plan trying a DGL-5500 next..

She does networking and I do devices. We have owned many routers over the years varying manufacturers including Netgear, some commerical and some SOHO.  I was not sold on Netgear based on past experience and almost bought a ASUS to try them out.  Reviews read in research and did not need another rebooting AP.I got this in a daily deal from Amazon after they put it on special (Day after they announced a new model at CES). My previous routers were Cisco, Linksys, Juniper, and DLink.  Each had their own issues that I could not stand. Most overheated/rebooted or were slow or had bad coverage (Cisco, Linksys, and DLink).  Some were very difficult to configure (Juniper). Some did not allow VPN pass through (How basic is this!). This one rocks all worlds.  I have a large network with 25 reserved DHCP assignments and other clients with various IPs. my old DLink was starting to time out on DHCP requests. I connect everything to the network, TVs, BlueRay, Amplifier, Garage door, Sump Pump, Door locks, Thermostat, PS3, xbox, Wii, Laptop PCs, MACs, Chromcast, and about 10 phones/tabs. I run both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz as well as a guest network on both.The Dlink was a higher end model, but just could not cut the mustard anymore. The USB sharing and print fuction required special software that only worked on one computer at a time and had to be manually disconnected when done.This provided me with all the features I wanted and then some.  I was considering a $200 NAS, but no more.  I attached a small 2TB 2.5&#34; USB 3.0 drive and share files with my PS3 and amplifier streaming movies and music.I attached a printer to the USB 2.0 slot and I am able to print from most devices, though my wife's MAC is giving me fits. This is the ONLY problem I have had with it.Wireless signal stregth is twice what I had previously. I had bought a directional antenna for my DLINK that still could not cover my house on 2.4Ghz, but this thing gives me 5Ghz in every room. I used to use a repeater to get to the second floor, but this covers the whole 3200sqft house from one corner. I have 75% signal on 5Ghz where I used to have none on 2.4Ghz in my bedroom.I recieved one update for the router.  When I logged it it let me know it had already downloaded the update and just needed to be rebooted.  All router updates should be this easy...none of this connect via cable and don't disconnect garbage, just click the button to update and wait for the reboot.Parental controls using DNS I had already setup, but this also gives me the ability to bypass them for my wife and my PCs using their client on either our phones, tabs, or laptops.To give you a frame of refrence on the speed and abilities I accidentially configured a bridge loop while migrating from my old router. Rookie move I know.  It would cause problems with the wired side accessing the internet over a few minutes, but wireless was running just fine in the mean time.  Once I figured out what I had done wrong (it took me about 20min because I never had a router able to keep one connection up with the other looping so I assumed this was not the problem) I was amazed at how well this handled my stupidity.  I believe this is due to the dual core processing.  While one processor was covering the bridge loop, the other was covering WIFI.I have been using this for over a few months now and can say I have not been happier. no more reboots, No more overheats, no more capacity problems, no more timeouts. So glad I don't have to do anymore workarounds.Speedwise to truely get the speeds being advertized for Wireless ac you need mulitple routers which I have not tried, but this does allow one to use all of the speed Google fiber can provide when their standard routers cannot support that. I have not seen 1700Mbps as a result, but I am getting the full speed from my internet provider now where previously I was limited by WIFI and router speeds.Their phone application is great too.  Between parental control buybass, troubleshooting, and statistics I can use this on site visits with customers to see all available netwroks and compare signal strength.  Once while changing printers I had unplugged my internet connection (broken tab on cat5 cable). I logged into the router to reboot remotely and it suggessted that I check the internet cable because it recently became detached. WOW, routers before never gave good tech advice. I checked and back in business in seconds.This is one of the best purchases I have ever made and makes me happy daily. I will buy another one and reccomend it to everyone who asks me for advice and I get asked a LOT for help. I have probably sold 3 more to friends and family already. Since I have to maintain them I get them what makes my life easier.  All have been happy with improved coverage and speed, most don't get the features..

I have seen few ask if this is all that can be connected to this device, I will be first or one of few to state, you can connect more than 3 devices, depending on your bandwidth of course.One the best features I can say that I liked is how you could connect to one of the usb ports a usb hub whether it be 4 ports, 8 ports, or even 12 ports, I think up to 14 ports(as I have not tried this yet) you can if running the feature for FTP or media server run up to that many hard drives(external, up to 2TB each) for data storage.* Example to explain you can plug into the router your hub, say example 4 ports 4 different external hard drives of up to 2TB each for total of 8 TB of data storage if doing backups, or you can stream your music, movies, etc. This router can be used for a media server basically if you wish to do so.* This was tested with my NETGEAR NAS Dou  and worked excellent.Compatibility: You can use this with all Windows Operating systems, Linux, and OSX (these are the platforms I tested this router with)Signal wise if you happen to have a dead sport in your basement as I did just running my DGND4000 on the highest channel, by setting the Nighthawk up to your network it will boost your hotspot in the basement, depending on the house construction may vary on your signal strength (example:" chicken wire, concrete, etc. may vary on signal strength).  Before hooking the R7000 up I had various signal strength with my smart phone, after connecting the R7000 I had and still have full signal strength with no interruptions.Overall this is an Excellent Router to have, I can throw in it is great to stream movies from an external hard drive and be able to watch it on your mobile device. Also depending how you set your network up, cloud wise, or not, say away and you have the right applications / software set up you can access your network for that missing assignment, or file for class or work(bandwidth may play a role on retrieving your data though)..

Not a single hiccup.Update #2:Reduced the number of splitters and replaced remaining ones with ones capable of up to 2.4 GHz. The Echo still locked up. Perhaps the R7000 is not compatible with Actiontec ECB2500C MoCA adapters. Tired of troubleshooting. I'm returning the router.Update:Removed the ActionTec ECB2500c MoCA adapters and created a very short-lengthed network using only CAT-5 cable. The Echo did not lock up. It is either the adapters, cables and/or splitters. The Linksys E2500 has no problem with this setup. Further study forthcoming.Original:I was looking for an AC gigabit router to handle the increasing traffic in my house. I have a Windows Media Center HTPC with a Ceton InfiniTV tuner and a Ceton Echo media extender. The Echo is set up to display at 720p. The HTPC and the Echo are connected to the router via MoCA adapters. This configuration worked well with a Linksys E2500 with only occasional lockups.When I start the Echo (after it has been off for awhile), it connects to the HTPC and plays for about a minute before displaying "Network Issue" and locks the display. Restarting the Echo, the live stream continues OK. Router status says that the Echo is still connected after it locks. This seems happens every time.The firmware was updated to the latest 1.0.2.194_1.0.15.I'll test for a few more days. If the problems continue, it is going back..

I have to mention that I understand a bit about speed, the wireless ac compared to 802.11b/g/n, able to handle multiple devices at any given time, two bands and that's it. I've learned Asus routers are also very good. After all the research made, I decided to purchase this router. My previous router was Netgear N900 and thus, familiar with Netgear Genie. I made a mistake during the setup (lost internet connection in the process) because I thought I'm that familiar with the step by step procedure. Fortunately, I used the &#34;automated&#34; service with my internet provider (Charter) to reset my internet and guide me through with the router installation. All in all, 15 minutes used.I can say that this AC Router is really good, fast, consistent with the speed link rates (checking them via Genie), you can enable Qos, readyshare connection, etc. As with N900, you can assign an SSID for guests (i.e. 2.4 or 5 GHz band) for them to connect so as to separate and not divulge the WPA2 passkeys for your family settings. It would also be beneficial to have an AC wireless USB 3.0 adapter on your PC and/or laptop to appreciate the speeds for the 5 GHz band. I used an S3 mini phone and went to the far corner of the  garage (10 ft. away from the house; router was 40 ft away) and still received 4 bars (out of 4) on a 5 GHz connection. My 5 year old laptop (has USB 2.0 port and I connected a USB 3.0 wireless ac adapter) was getting link rate at 780 Mbps (10X faster than before).I was also prepared that in case I received a bad router, I was ready to ask Amazon for a replacement and I usually have no issues asking for a replacement. But, I received a good item and this router is performing really well for several days now.I would recommend this product to those who would want to upgrade for a faster network connection and be able to handle several devices all at the same time..

I bought it primarily for the vastly increased WiFi range talked about in reviews, and it did the trick, as we now get a signal in the furthest rooms, and our ChromeCast now shows 4/4 bars (through 3 walls and the TV) instead of 2/4 allowing it to finally stream 1080p from YouTube without a hiccup.Biggest PROs of this router (all hardware):1) #1 ranked router @ smallnetbuilder.com2) AC WiFi support for new devices like the Galaxy Note 3 and Nexus 5.3) Supports open DD-WRT firmware (turns a $200 router into a thousand-dollar router)Biggest CON, BY FAR (in software), and the only reason I docked 1 star:*) No DNSMasq support(!), which makes looking up static dhcp hosts impossible. e.g.: '$ ping laserjet' fails.The latest Netgear firmware (V1.0.1.22 as of this review) thankfully supports static dhcp leases -- called an "Address Reservation Table" by Netgear -- which allows you to give devices on your LAN a static IP and hostname by MAC address. However, since Netgear isn't using DNSMasq, these hosts can't also be resolved by name on the LAN (192.168.1.1 nameserver), which makes their implementation only half-useful. If not for this glaring oversight I might've stuck with Netgear's stock firmware indefinitely, but it's crippling, and so I'm glad I have the option of flashing DD-WRT in order to get this functionality back, as well as hundreds of other features only seen in high-end routers, such as sshd, more vpn options, etc.NetGear, if you're listening: please add dnsmasq support (instead of proxy to ISP only) in your next firmware update.

I really like the router but give it only 4-stars because of the MAC address issue.  the genie utility is nice as well.  You can monitor the network and limit the kids access.The one downside is the MAC address seems to get "stuck" and I've had to release/renew the MAC address at least once a week for about 4 weeks.  This can be done using the netgear website and utilities but it's a pain.  I'm trying to see if it's the router or the fiber connection from my telco.  I found some tech notes to do an "ipconfig /release and/or /renew" from the command line of my W7 PC which for some reason solved the issue and hasn't popped up since.Follow-up 1-8-14A netwgear firmware update seems to have resolved the MAC address issue.  Like many others have experienced, the genie apps doesn't allow me to connect to the router. My workaround  is pressing the Rest button on the back of the unit(need a pin or small object) that resets things and access to the router can be done but don't hold your breath that you can re-access if you exit.  It almost seems that when you exit or logout genie/rotuer doesn't release the session and from that point forward genie thinks you're already accessing it?!?!

I didn't expect that much of a performance increase, however I did expect an increase in range for the 5Ghz band. Online reviews were great, so I bought it at a local store. I also bought it because it specifically advertises that it is great for online gaming.At first, it was doing great. The range 5Ghz range was better than the R6300, so I was pleased, however I could only get a  585 Mpbs connection with my wireless AC adapter (also by Netgear, the A6200). This is the same I speed it connected to the R6300. Might be the location (almost directly upstairs), but that was a bit disappointing. I believe this to be the adapter's fault, more than the routers. However, this connection would fluctuate between 585 and 140 Mpbs; the R6300 kept it solid at 585 Mpbs. Does this really matter?Also, after about 30 minutes to an hour, I noticed the 5Ghz connection wasn't as reliable as with the R6300. At first I was getting download/upload speeds close to my advertised line speed (92 Mpbs on a 100 Mpbs line), but over time this would sporadically drop down to between 50 and 70 Mpbs, which is a significant loss. Sometimes I would only get around 10 - 15 Mpbs, with an upload of .5 Mpbs! A router reset would put this back to normal. My R7000 came packaged with the most recent firmware update, and so I thought it might be a cleverly repackaged customer return from the store I bought it from, so I did a hard reset. No change.These unreliable connections didn't happen only with wireless connections; it was also with the 1 GB ethernet connections as well. I am using Cat 5E cabling (all under 50 feet) and speed tests were similar to the above wireless connections. Streaming games was not as smooth as they were with the R6300, and sometimes streaming movies would be a hit or miss situation; with the R6300, I never had problems streaming HD movies.After logging onto the Netgear forums, I noticed I wasn't the only one having unreliable connections. To be fair, my R6300 had similar problems when I first bought it, but the firmware updates ironed them out over time into a near-rock solid unit. So I do believe Netgear will improve the unit into a rock-solid device as well, it just may take some firmware updates to do it. I am using it as an access point now, for the far side of the house, and I only use it at night when I am in the bed. Once the problems are fixed above, I'll try it out again. I don't recommend shelling out close to $200.00 for an access point, or extender, however.I do, however, recommend the R6300..

That said this is an excellent router with only one slight flaw. For link speeds above ~130Mbps you must enable 40 MHz bandwidth by disabling the 20 MHz play nice with other routers, setting. The flaw is that if there is heavy interference the router can apparently switch 20MHz then stay on that setting. So if link speed drops by about half check the settings.I am writing this while sitting in a metal shed 45 feet from the router inside the house. Its max 2.4 GHz rate is 450 Mbps (using channels 11 + 7), the link speed to the USB wireless adapter is 300 Mbps and signal strength is -43 dB. Throughput during the Comcast speed test is 29.3 Mbps. 300Mbs is the maximum for theMonoprice USB Wireless LAN 802.11N High Power Adapter with 2 Antenna (108076)and the speed test matches the Comcast provisioned speed.The router is not near the center of the house, but speeds are very good in every room and in the backyard. The router has been running for a month and so far no real problems..
