Currently, I have a pair of skullcandy earbuds, a pair of the stock iPod earbuds and a pair of $35 Sony Studio headphones (the big over-the-ear ones).They were not working for me. The sound on the Sony ones were pretty decent, but prolonged use made my ears ache and could get very warm in the wrong climate (like...summer). They were also very heavy, so reading text books or just reading my Kindle, these things would not cut it as it would also put strain on my neck. My ears were just not made for earbuds, as I had various problems with those. The iPod earbuds failed miserably, as the sound was always too shallow for me and they kept falling out of my ears.So, I looked for the most rated headphones (not earbuds) with over a 4 star rating on Amazon and stumbled across these. Over a 1000 reviews and it still had 4 1/2 stars? Yeah, I'll take some time to check these out lol.So I got them a week ago. To avoid any "premature" reviewing, I let them sit the first three days with music on constantly, racking up about 36-40 hours of "break in" time before I tried them out objectively.First the headphones themselves. They are very, very light. The head band are a couple of thin metal bands with plastic pieces that adjust size. I like this because metal is durable but it's also light and airy and doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing a music factory on my head.The ear pads are more comfortable than I imagined. They are not dollar store ear pads (although they look that way) and are comfortable on the ears.A wildly awesome thing about these phones that people often overlook are all the parts that make them comfortable. The ear pieces themselves are hinged, so they bend depending on the shape of your ear. The metal bands are firm but flexible so it doesn't press too hard on the head or ears. Then there's comfortzone settings. It took a minute to figure out how the settings work, but once I did I was treated to a unique comfort experience. Comfortzone consists of two pads on either side that rest on the temples. The firmer the settings, the more pressure on your temples and less on your ears. I found this awesome as I could sit with these headphones on my head for 8 straight hours and feel no ear fatigue at all.Now for the part everyone wants to read: the sound. I am NOT an audiophile and I won't use any technical terms. The music sounded just plain great. I can hear bass lines in rock songs, hip-hop and rap songs thump (but not uncomfortably so). The music sounds whole and complete and not shallow and airy like iPod headphones do. The high notes sound good and even at high volumes don't cackle or distort and in no song that I listened to did anything sound muddy or wrong. The volume is well balanced. Maxed out is too loud and that's something my other pairs of headphones can't say. I've often had to max out settings just to get a decent volume on my Sony headphones. These I can keep in the middle volume range and it still sounds good.They're not noise cancelling and they leak sound. I'm okay with this because when I jog, I'd like to hear the cars coming before they hit me ;) so if you're looking for noise cancelling and quiet for others, then you should probably keep searching.All in all, for the price, I can't imagine having gotten a better pair of headphones. Personally, I love the retro style of the headphones. Keep in mind that Chucks have fallen in and out of style for 90 years and they're top sellers. This has been in and out of style for nearly 30 years and it's a top seller. I put them in the same category (and, as it happens, own both now) which is "totally awesome". If you're looking for some lightweight phones that sound great and have a unique look, then your search is over. I wish I'd found these 15 years ago when I started using headphones for the first time..

No other headphones combine this level of comfort, soundstage, openness, and plain excitement into such a compact, durable, and CHEAP package.  These are tiny tiny tiny, but rock out with authority.There's been a lot of jibber jabber on these fair internets about the newest contender for the portable headphone crown - the Sennheiser PX100.  I bought a pair of those Senns and lived with them for a couple of months - they are acceptable for a set of portable cans, I guess, but tend to get very congested and cluttered in the midrange.  They're also bland and cold.  Beyond sound, they're not even as comfortable as the PortaPros, as they require constant adjustment to stay on top of your head while you're walking around.  Finally, the Senns are not only less durable than the PortaPros, but the warranty is only two years vs.  Koss's incredible NO QUESTIONS ASKED LIFETIME WARRANTY.  That's right, you never have to buy a set of headphones again, until you die.  Just incredible.  If you want to demo this sound t a lower price, try out the Koss KSC 75 ear clip model, but be warned they're nowhere near as comfortable.  Buy with confidence..

I have tried MANY earbud type sets as they are the best for portabilty. I could not find a pair that could give me a wide spectrum of sound at a decent price. I do have a pair of Ultimate Ears MetroFi 150v that came pretty close to what I was looking for (they were a steal at $16.00 shipped from Dell). However, I needed a pair of headphones that were comfortable for extended periods and most of all sounded great. Well, after reading the reviews here I figured I would give these a try. I was shocked when I cranked up my iPod Touch with some Metallica and could hear ALL of the music without distortion. The Koss Porta-pros are very "airy" and do not cut off the world around you yet they produce a very clear and natural sound that is hard to find in any other headset under $75+. I am very picky about sound since I used to do sound engineering for a 8 piece band and got used to hearing a live, wide range of sound with detail that is very percise. The bass response with the Porta-Pros is natural and clean, the mids are natural and full and the treble is also clear and true. I am very pleased with these headphones and honestly the lifetime warranty sealed the deal. I remember when I was a kid in the early 70s. My father bought me a Koss headphone set (I cannot remember the model), but listening to the current top 40 music of the day from my simple record player, I remember how good those headphones sounded back then and how it would transport me into another world.

They are very good and yes they get better after a break-in.For this money they should be on your short list.It appears people have luck with these lasting for years and are a product really worth the price for once.Update 07/2012Holding up and sounding great!.

They are lightweight, very comfortable, and retain the same clarity of the larger phones I used to have. These are excellent for listening to acoustic music as well as rock. The highs are crisp and clean and bass is fat and full, but not overwhelming like the Dre's.  One of the things that I noticed more so than other headphones I've own is the separation of sound. You can distinguish the left and right channel clearly. It totally adds to the listening experience.

Cord length is sufficient without being too long.  I like them but they were purchased for my grandson; now we will see how durable they are.  Great value for a reasonable price from Amazon..

They are a classic design from the eighties which is now nouveau chic again.I am a heavy heavy tech user and like to use high quality items and I demand a lot from them.With that said these are my new favorite headphones (the one's that travel with me everywhere).I was skeptical even after reading all the reviews, thinking "How could something so reasonably priced really be as good as all of these reviews suggest." Well they can be and are, consider my doubts banished as I was pleasantly surprised. The reviews are correct, this is Koss' masterpiece, homerun, the epitome of what Koss represents.I have a pair of Bose Triport Headphones and Senneheiser PX200's both of which are excellent headphones....and these Porta Pros are commandingly better (the Triports are "warmer" and the Senneheisers crisper, but I like the sound of these best as they are the cleanest clearest balance of warmth & crispness).They are light weight, foldable, exceptionally comfortable and of coarse the sound quality is excellent.Actually, I cannot say enough about the sound quality, it is well balanced, full, hits the highs, lows and everything in between accurately. They produce clean scratch that pristine audio that is a pleasure to listen to. I find myself searching out music that can challenge or push these and they just keep on producing beautiful music to my ears.Essentially they are awesome. (period) They sound and function better than headphones easily two or three times their price, look cool if you're into retro and they are dirt cheap.CONCERNS:The only concerns if any are that the part that connects the earpiece to the headphone part doesn't seem very robust and may break eventually(though I haven't had any issues). Some may find that the metal headband might catch on their hair (something else I haven't had an issue with, though I have short hair) and finally, the foam pads over the earphones sort of scream I'm cheap and I will wear out on you. In defense of them, it does keep with the whole retro thing, it's really comfortable, it's easily replaceable, and they are in fact inexpensive, essentially who cares. Many of these small things have been ever so slightly adjusted on the Anniversary Edition of these gorgeous nearly perfect headphones (but for twice the price I wouldn't bother). Oh and Koss has an included lifetime warranty for the life of the product, ridiculous!(amazing) For me this tosses basically all of the concerns out the window.Conclusion:-Beautiful design and function (form and function married beautifully, just one of those products that is right on, balanced, perfect in most ways) Clearly the designers got it and knew what they were doing when they made these.-Koss' famous lifetime warranty.-Worth every penny, I would feel good about paying twice the price and wouldn't bat an eye. Awesome part is you don't have to. I would buy them again, for myself or others..

Many MP3 players sacrifice a resonable amp for smaller size, so these Porta Pros will help salvage players with diminutive amps.The only complaint with my Porta Pros is they are open ear, and people are always noticing my music, even though they all admit I'm not listening that loud once they try them on..

You've already read the hundreds rave reviews of the Portapro's phenomenal sound and being that I am in agreement with them all, I have little to add. I have several head phones from different manufacturers such as AKG, Sony, and Sennheiser and these beat all the more expensive open air and closed air headphones I have. The only headphones that are better are in-ear variety which I use conditions with a lot external noise such as on planes and working out at the gym.However, recently I have fallen out of love with my Portapros and I think there are a lot of Portapro users who are in the closet about this particular design flaw that I'm about to elaborate on. First of all, let me explain that I have several mp3 players. Recently, I acquired mp3 players with large amounts of flash memory (16gb). Because of the long battery life inherent in these players (25 to 30 hours), I'm pretty much listening to them all day long, along with my Portapros. I wear these instead of the better sounding isolation earbuds because I need to hear the phone and be able to talk to people while wearing them.With my extended hours of usage, I've been noticing that when I remove my Portapros, about 7 times out of 10 they pull at least one of my hairs out. I have developed a method of slow removal combined with pushing together adjustable metal frame that reduces the instance of this. This acts to release any hairs that have been captured by the sliding mechanism. However, because many times, I have to answer the phone quickly, I find myself having to pull off the Portapros at more normal speed -- and this results in too many instances of unauthorized hair removal.Because of the great sound of the Portapro, I have been will to put up with it...until last night.Last night I was at Office Depot and on a whim I purchased the Sony MDR-E828LP Fontopia Earbuds (with the wind-up case) for about 10 bucks. These are the most generic basic earbuds that Sony makes. Over the years, I have owned several of these and my experience with them was that these were entry-level headphones with entry-level sound. But when I plugged them in, I was in for a pleasant shock. These sounded great. They must of done some design improvements since I last tried them. Excellent full spectrum sound for metal, jazz, classical -- everything I listen to. Tight, natural bass response that, in my opinion, is at least 97% of the greatness of the Portapro -- all for a measly 10 bucks. Better sounding than the other headphones I have that cost several times as much.Long story short...I've switched to Sony Fontopia's for the time being. The fact that they're not "in the ear" allows me to hear the phone and talk to people. But best of all -- no hair pulling.I still like the Portapros for their sound. In fact a week ago, I wrote an email to Koss explaining the problem and they politely explained they were working a solution that didn't compromise the positive qualities of the current design.That's cool. I'll be waiting. For now, I've hung up my Portapros. If there are other folks out there who have a problem with hair pulling like I did, the Sony Fontopia are a nice alternative for the being.Revision 2/28/2011In recent months, I've migrated back to using my Portapros. I'm just more careful when I take them off. There's nothing else like the sound on these babies. While I hope you guys fix the hair pulling, you're back to 5 stars..

They appear to be well made and I anticipate using them for a long time.I also bought a pair of the cheaper Koss PRO1 phones in a two-fer Amazon deal when I bought these, and they're excellent sounding portable phones as well.  The metal construction of the PortaPros likely give them an advantage in durability; the sound quality between the two is comparable.  If you're interested in portable phones and want a better balance of highs, mids and more lows than you usually get with such phones (enough low end so that you won't need to use the annoying, sound-sucking bass boost found on most portable players), with good construction to boot, I highly recommend the PortaPros.

I do not like to block up my ears with ear plugs all day for health concerns. I have bought and used these:Sony MDR-CD230Sony MDR-V6Sony MDR-XD200My ears are not real fussy on quality, nearly all headphones give my ears a problem by pressing them against my eyeglass arms and this hurts, usually after 10-20 minutes of listening. My hatsize if about 7.25,my ears are pretty normal in size, I am middle aged. All three of these headphones I own are the best I have tried on or read reviews by eyeglass wearers over past 2 years. Headphones have a left and right side - the cord typically is attached to the left side, and the ear spaces, or cups, are oriented accordingly, to that the back of the ear lobe has more space to sit in than the front of the ear lobe. The sideways pressure (how hard they clamp onto your head) also is a secondary factor in whether my ears hurt. I wear wireframe glasses, and my use for headphones is background music while I program.$30 The CD230 is no longer available, that I could find (Fall 2006), and I've used them for 5 years. They hurt my ears after 3-4 hours of continual use, but are good before that. They have cloth covered ear cushions, and relatively deep ear lobe spaces. This feature in all earphone seems to be the primary feature that determines whether my ears hurt or not. If you can find these, and like cloth covered headphones, you won't be unhappy. The sideways pressure is light for me.$64 The V6 stands out for 2 things - richness and accuracy of the sound and blocking out outside office noises. Listening to classical music, not real loud, a co-worker can speak to my face and his voice is muffled pretty well. (Women's voices too). Overheard conversations are not overheard.I have used these occaisionally for a couple months and my ears/head get sore after 1-2 hours. The sideways pressure is noticeably more than the other two, but not excessive. They are well cushioned, with soft fake thin leather-like vinyl which I did not find causes sweating at all. But there is not a large space for the ear lobes to sit, and this is what causes pressure after a while to build up uncomfortably I am sure. If I did not have my eyeglasses on, then these are very comfortable.$26 The XD200 is a little lighter than the V6, it does not block out outside noises as well, which can be a benefit in the office because I can hear co-workers calling my name. The sideways pressure is light, the cushion is the same thickneess as the V6 but the ear space is much deeper for the earlobe, so for this reason it is the most comfortable of all headphones I've owned or tried. The cushions are covered in the thin leather-like vinyl like the V6 - this stuff feels like a paper much more than a plastic, it feels dry, not clammy. To my unprofessional ears the sound is great. If you wear eyeglasses, don't want to use ear plugs for hours at a stretch, then I think you will be happiest with the Sony MDR-XD200 headphones..

It seems Sony did something right 20-30 years ago and hasn't strayed from the formula since. This set looks good, fits well, and sounds great. They definitely need a few hours to loosen up to get their best sound, but it's worth it. I feel like I hear everything when I'm listening to music. They block out outside sound well enough for me.The cups are comfortable and large enough for my ears. They are highly durable; I'm not afraid to throw them around a little bit, or even stuff them into my backpack. The coiled cord can get heavy at times. I wish it was more of a flat cord and had a cord wrangler like my old Sennheiser HD202s (a good low-end set), but if it helps it sound they way it does I'm more than okay with it.There is the higher-end-marketed Sony MDR7506 but these are basically the same. Some detailed reviews reveal only slight differences in the two sets' response patterns, but it's hardly noticeable. The only real difference is that the 7506 has a gold-tipped jack whereas the V6 does not. One reviewer noted that if the set was going to be plugged and unplugged repeatedly (I.e. NOT installed in a studio setting) the gold plating could eventually wear off. As I take my set on the go and plug into various devices, this was fine with me.You cannot find a better set of headphones for under $100. I would recommend these to anybody that likes music..

With today's 2-3 year product cycle, old technology becomes outdated and obsolete fast, forcing many once revered products into retirement. This is extremely impressive when you consider the company that makes these headphones is Sony; a huge multinational corporation that rarely has any one product out for more than 2 years. So why have they stuck around for so long? Simple; because they're amazing. No set of headphones in this price class (and several above) can hope to come close to how balanced these things are. All frequencies are represented accurately; just as they were recorded and without any coloration. Bass lines aren't bloated mess's like in many modern headphones, mid range frequencies are as they should be; in existence, and treble is highly detailed without scraping at your ears. Though not as detailed as a set of $500 headphones, these are not anywhere close to that. Hovering around $65 most days, these cans provide incredible value. Don't take this the wrong way; they're not amazing for what they are, they're amazing period. Buy these for editing, sound stage monitoring, or neutral listening and you won't be disappointed.

I love that I can listen to dance, orchestral, rock, rap, or basically any style of music with these. The other neat thing about these headphones is that they're standard equipment at nearly every studio ever. So you're more than likely listening on the same headphones that the engineers who mixed down your music used.The simple fact is that these headphones blow $200 beats and other 'designer' headphones out of the water. They just faithfully reproduce sound instead of slamming you with pure bass.One drawback, which might just be a personal thing: they're too narrow for my head. I could just have a wide head, but I feel like the arms are pushing too hard against the sides of my head. I realize that this is partly necessary for good sound (keeps the earcups seated on your ears) but I feel like it could be toned down a bit..

My reason for purchasing a second pair (and getting both models) was because these V6's were very inexpensive at the time I ordered, and because I was curious to see if I could tell a difference between the two. In reading many of the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences (if any) and which has the superior sound.These are both headphones in the $100 and below price category, which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound. I do not like to listen to music using earbuds, I prefer this style of "over-the-ear" headphone. although it does take some getting used to. I also have very inexpensiveKoss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphonesfor occasions when I don't want to use my more expensive Sony's.I am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones (both models), and with the comfort. They are the first "quality" headphones that I have owned, and the level of detail in the sound, lack of distortion, and overall quality is simply superb. I am completely satisfied.Now, regarding both similarities and differences between the Sony MDR-7506 and Sony MDR-V6, here is what I have observed:- externally, they are almost identical in construction and appearance. The V6 has red stickers on each headphone "for Digital", and the 7506 has blue stickers "Professional". The phono jack for the V6 is silver metal (all metal), for the 7506 is gold (rubber and gold). Those are the only visible differences I am able to detect.- when I listen to the two headphones back to back, at the same volume level and with the same music, I can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the 7506, and very slightly clearer sound. This is consistent with several of the other reviewers on Amazon for the 7506, who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the 7506, with the V6's sounding a bit warmer. One reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different - the 7506 uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels, where the V6 uses a single ground for both channels. (It seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway, but maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound).- some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones. However when I went to Sony's website to check the specifications for the two models, that is not what I found. And here is what the Wikipedia page states for these headphones: "both models share the same part number for their driver, but the magnet therein is known to vary. The MDR-7506 was introduced with a samarium-cobalt magnet, as is currently used in the MDR-V6. However, at some point, the MDR-7506 switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet. These changes were made without changing the driver part number."- The box for the 7506 states "neodimium magnet". The operating instructions included with the V6 state "samarium cobalt magnet". Possibly either or both of these are out of date (as Wiki states, they may make spec changes over time) - the 7506 box is copyright 1994, and the V6 copyright is 1996.- The 7506 box includes an exploded view and parts list, which is very nice to have. The V6 box does not.- Both headphones include a soft case for storing/carrying the headphones, and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo mini-plug or a normal size plug.UPDATE 7/22/13 and 7/30/13: The Sony MDR-V6 and MDR-7506 headphones have just recently been reviewed by CNET, with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality. Both headphones receive a very high recommendation from CNET. See the MDR-7506 review at [...] and the MDR-V6 review at [...]According to the specifications on Sony's website (which should be up-to-date), the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response:- MDR-7506:- Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 10-20kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity- MDR-V6:- Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 5-30kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivityI am not able to explain how Sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical, but this is what they are saying. And the two headphones do have slightly different sound.Although there is a slight difference between the 7506 and V6, the sound from both headphones is very neutral. The "professional" choice between the two seems to be the 7506, and it is the more expensive model. If you read other reviews you will find that the 7506's are commonly used by studio engineers, because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is, without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do. At this point, for me they are both excellent, and for thirty bucks less I'd go with the V6 if I could have only one of the two.I've been using these headphones with theAudioengine D1 24-bit digital-to-audio converter, and I am extremely pleased with the quality of the sound.As a final comment, some owners of these headphones comment that the ear pads wear out over time, and some owners also prefer different ear pads for better comfort. I also purchased a pair ofBeyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushionsfor this reason, and although I have not yet given them a try to compare them with the ear pads that come with the Sony headphones, I do like the fact that it is possible to fit different ear pads if desired in order to provide more comfort, as well as replace them when they have become worn (some owners use these headphones for many years).I notice that there are a very large number of reviewers for these headphones, many of them long-time owners who feel very strongly that these Sony headphones are the best. I'm just beginning to use them, but I have high hopes that they will be durable over time and that I will continue to be as satisfied with them as I am today..

I considered the 7506 but I usually take good care of my electronics so I didn't want to pay the extra $15 for it.  Anyway, I just want to write a review as there are some questions that I wished were answered before purchasing. Before I start, I want to let people know that this is my first over the ear headphone.  I always use earbuds due to it portability.  I run with them so the V6 isn't ideal in that situation. Okay, now the review.The product:It is very well made, no cheap plastic parts.  The wires are long and good for sitting in one place to listen to your music, esp from a receiver.  If you have to walk around while holding your portable music player like my zune hd, then it can be a handful to hold bc you will need to carry the cord around along with your music player.  Not a big deal, but just a heads up if you are looking for something a little more portable and manageable.  I have been using this for a couple of days now and the earpieces hurt my ears after an hour of use.  People said it will get better.  I only hope so, but I bought a Beyerdynamic replacement because I heard it is more comfortable and that it will make the music even better too.  I also heard the original earpiece won't last very long.  My other complaint of the original earpiece, like others have stated, is that my ears get warm after 15 minutes of use and becomes sweaty.The music:I have used $30 sony earbuds and $60 klispch earbuds before and I have to say that this definitely sounds better.  The lows are deep, the mids are excellent, and the highs are very clear.  The biggest difference between this and my other earbuds is the clarity of the music, especially the vocal. I don't know if the earbud's small single driver or its proximity from inside the ear canal that is causing the sound to be muddy, but this over the ear headphones make the music sound more natural and clear.  I used to love a lot of bass in my music and I still do as I listen to Trance often. If you are looking for a headphone with booming overpowering bass, then this might not be for you.  I was a bit underwhelmed by the loudness of the bass when I first listened to Tiesto or Hip Hop music.  I am not saying that the bass isn't good, it is very good, very deep.  It's just not eardrum breaking. =P. For alternative, pop, and other music that emphasize vocals and a dynamic range of bass and treble, this headphone performs brilliantly.  You can hear all the different instrument being played very clearly. It actually made me fall in love with the vocal of one of my favorite female singer. ^_^ If your MP3 conversion isn't great, then you can hear all the crackles and static. I don't know if that is a good thing or bad.  One thing I noticed is that I needed to turn up the volume a little more compared to my earbuds to hear the music on the same loudness level.  I think perhaps portable music player like my zune HD requires a bit more power for the headphone compared to earbuds.  I usually listen to my zune HD at level of 18-20, but with the V6, I listen between 20-23. I love music and this headphone has taught me to appreciate it even more.  I have learned to love the quality of the music now, and not just the loudness of the bass.  As for noise cancellation, it does reduce outside noise by about 33% IMO but there is no noise cancellation, passive or active. You can hear outside noise without music turned on.Update after a month of use:Music still sounds great.  Only problem I have is that the earpiece is so uncomfortable.  They press against my ears and hurt a lot after an hour of use.  It also gets very sweaty too.  Please keep this in mind before deciding your purchase..

Mostly used for mostly music playback and some PC gaming. These headphones fit the bill. At their price, how can you beat these?Sound, these have a great sound. Just so you know where I'm coming from...I've been married to my Bose Triport headphones that I bought years ago. I paid $150 for those. Compared to those, soundwise, they're about even, with the edge going to the sturdier Sony's. The sound is excellent at the bottom, mid's and highs. I found the sound level to be even accross the sound field. Very flat. But flat in a good way, as these can produce very good lows, mids and highs. Not any one particular range dominated, which is perfect.Construction is without a doubt, excellent. These things will take a beating. The cushions are comfortable. I have a huge head and I found these to be fine. Not tight or uncomfortable.The only ding against this fine headset is the cord, it's long, thick and heavy. Not very portable. I wish there was a way to mod the wiring to put something like what Bose uses on these, then these would be PERFECT. I believe a different version of this headset has a more portable wire. 3.5mm jack is not compatible with iPhone's bumper case. Carrying case is thick and cheap looking.Overall, if you're a headset aficionado, I think you will appreciate these. A fine headset to add to the collection. Pass on the Beats by Dre, save money and enjoy.**UPDATE**10/21/2013**The cord was really getting to me, so I cut it. Big mistake. I was hoping to just splice the wiring and make the wire shorter, and manageable. When I went to cut the cord and strip the ends, I found these very thin wires. I believe they were L channel, R channel and ground. Well, when I went to touch the ends together and test, I got no audio whatsoever. GREAT, just killed a perfectly good set of headphones. Well, long story short, I was able to solder the ends together, insulate the solder with electrical tape and fix the headphones. Worked like a charm. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I lucked out. I thought this set was cooked for sure..

Little did I know that Sony still makes the same model! That's right, some 18 years later, I now own my own pair of the exact same headphones. If the fact that Sony still makes the same headphones without any changes doesn't say enough about these, then nothing I say would do much justice, but I'll try anyway.I have a 24" head and despite the other reviewers who have said these headphones fit too tightly, I bought them anyway. Once I got them I did notice they are a bit tight, but since I have no plans to sit in one spot for more than a few hours with these on, this is not a concern to me. Plus, in time I expect them to loosen up a bit simply through constant use. The padding on the ears are very nice, but I can see how wearing these for hours on end might get a bit annoying, but that would probably happen with anything you put on/in your ears.Once on, I can't think of any other headphones I've tried that sound as good. For my desktop speakers, I use aKlipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System (Black)that sounds amazing when playing songs through iTunes or Pandora, so I needed something better than the Apple earphones I was using when I didn't want to blast out my roommates. The MDR-V6 headphones do just that. Of course they don't have the same punch as a floored subwoofer, but surprisingly, the bass in these headphones is quite noticeable.Until I bought these, I wasn't even really using the iTunes equalizer. Now as I change music, I change the EQ because the headphones make you hear sounds you've never heard before! I feel like going back through all my music just to see what I've been missing..

The Grados "were" the best but they need to call Stanley tools or someone so they can construct something that lasts.4. The Able planets were out of this world with a battery running. No other headphone needs a battery.  These phones are the best next to the Bose for noise cancelling and bargain.There is a problem with 3 of the headphones. The Grados are very weakly constructed. I had a whole can fall off.  I crazy glued the muff.  I mean can. No big deal(stronger than ever seriously).My opinion Grado, with my most respect should crazy glue the notch you put in to the cans to hold the phone to the set. The sound quality of Grados  are out of this world. Construction JUNK! Truth!I hooked the Sonys and the Sennheisers to an amp for my music. Not your stereo. a Guitar amp.

At first, when I first tried it, it sounded weird on my film soundtracks because I wasn't used to it, but after getting used to it I wondered what the heck I had been listening to with my last headphones. These new headphones make songs from a month ago sound too good!Third, the the ease of use is flawless, except sometimes when you take them off and put them back on, you might have to spread the earcups out as they like to be together.Fourthly is the comfort. I was thinking of giving this a four star, but decided not to. The reason why, was because the COIL. Yes the coil. That long cord. If you late it hang down next to your chair, it sometimes causes to send a beat back to your headphones. Not a sound, but you feel it, and it's annoying-- so I try to keep my wire on top of the desk. I might coil it up later when I feel like it. Other than that, it's perfect, except it does kind of block out sound so, if someone is calling you, forget it >.&lt; lolEDIT after over a year of use:The sound quality is great! Sometimes the wire can get in the way because of its weight, but if you keep it on the desk, which is really easy to do, there is no problem. The earpads are comfortable too. But there is a problem with this device. Despite its pros, the earpads aren't very strong, and replacements are even worse, AND harder to put on. The earpads that came with the device lasted 6 months. This is good. However, replacement pads I bought didn't last long at all, 1-3 months usually (one or both earpads). I've had to buy like 6 replacement pads. I admit, I might not be putting them on EXACTLY right, which I intend to take every precaution when buying a deluxe version pair, but still, the internal gradual ripping of the material covering the inner foam just keeps happening. Like I said, when I get the deluxe pair, I will try my best to put it on perfectly, but I'm still hoping for the best..

The only con I have is that the chord is very long and heavy with the coils, so it hangs off of my computer desk and I can *just* feel the weight of it especially when I move my head.

I've tried them on multiple devices--phone, tablet, PC, even on a home stereo with the adapter it comes with.  Same problem everywhere.

Bass to me means tight, deep, sonorous, well-intonated double bass (i.e., contrabass, upright acoustic bass), not the moo-moo-burp-moo boomy, muddy bass that generally comes out of rock bass guitars. These cheap little headphones deliver the kind of bass I want to hear. The mid and treble instruments sound great, too. And they're comfortable; I could wear them for hours at a time. I personally prefer a one-sided cord, but that's not likely to be found in a cheap headphone. In any case, I would gladly give that up for phones of this quality at this price.I've been using Sennheiser PX 100 phones with iTunes on my computer for years, and these Panasonic RP-HT21 headphones compare very favorably at a fraction of the price. You need to adjust the volume up somewhat compared to the PX 100s, which is easy enough to do, and after I do that I'm not sure I could tell them apart. The RP-HT21s don't fold up, but I use them at several locations around my home so that doesn't matter.These headphones are a steal at the price. Get 'em before they disappear. I and others will be ordering backups.PS: I'm not hard on my headphones. If these don't hold up over time, I'll adjust my rating downward, but how much time do to want for this tiny price?.

These headphones, on the other hand, have already provided me with countless hours of entertainment (and they're calorie free)!There is no better deal out there for comfortable, quality headphones. I've used these almost every day for the past couple of months, for any length of time between 2 and 6 hours while at work. I've had the opportunity to borrow high end headphones from friends and coworkers, like Bose and Beats. Are the Beats better than these four dollar headphones? Yes, of course they are. But they are not 40x better (roughly the extra amount of money you would have to pay for them)! I use headphones all the time, I'm hard on them, and they all will eventually break. I would much rather replace these $4 headphones (I already ordered another pair, to have on hand), than ship off my $300 headphones for service.And they're not junk, not by any means. The sound quality is excellent (for the average listener, like me), and the bass is very, very good. Build quality is excellent (especially when you consider the price), with a thick cord and nothing that feels flimsy.

I was told that a certain brand of earbuds were comfortable and sounded very good, so I bought them and was very disappointed in the sound, especially the booming bass.

I decided to take a chance on it and I'm very glad I did.  Not only does it sound terrific on soft and loud passages (and I like my classical music loud) but it's very comfortable as well.

Although it seems to shoot images as good as my old f1.4, this lens is still not the little gem that my old 1.4 was. This 1.8D is a bit lighter and more plastic feeling. The focus ring is not as smooth and offers little resistance that I was accustomed to on the previous lens I owned. Although for just a pinch over $100 its a great bargain for a Nikon lens. I would recomend this lens to someone on a budget. If you got a couple hundred extra bucks to just get rid of, buy the f1.4.

I agree. I also have a D40 and used this lens on it. The focus action is stiffer. Focus travel is short, too. As a consequence the electronic rangefinder inside the D40 (focus dot indicator) flickers when focusing by hand. Purely manual focus (MF) Nikon lens are much easier to focus on the D40. For example, the MF 35-105mm Nikkor smoothly gets in and out of focus without flickering the focus indicator, as does the 55mm f/2.8 micro Nikkor. Both MF lenses have ample focus travel and will nail the focus indicator without difficulty.I shot an event inside the church using ISO 400 film with this lens. Scenes were correctly exposed with only the builtin flash of my Nikon F75 to fill-in nearby subjects. Set at f2, my photos were sharp and showed correct balance of flash and ambient light including candles and chandelier lights. Without the wide aperture of this lens, I would have to resort to a bigger flash gun (inconvenient) higher ISO film (hard to find) or shutter speed slower than 1/60.One other thing I observed with this lens is that it is quite tighter than other lenses to mount on the camera. I am not sure if its just my lens. I read somewhere that someone also noticed this. If you have the same observation, just be careful not to press the lens body too much in mounting it to the camera.As you can see from the picture, the lens body is rather colorful and these markings carry significance. You may not see the same marks on G model lenses which come as the usual kit lens. The depth-of-field scale, distance scale, and aperture readout scale that are written on the 50mm f/1.8 lens body gives important information for those who are new to photography. For this reason I highly recommend this lens instead of a zoom lens lacking this information, if you have a choice.This is a wonderful lens for both Nikon film and digital SLRs. I used it regularly on my film camera where I fully appreciate its value. But bear in mind that it may be a challenge for you to use it on the D40/x, which of course, is neither the camera's nor the lens' fault.Although many people stay away from the 50mm focal length for its limited angle, I find it to be a very good lens for just about any scene. I always believe that a simple lens like this has way more potential as a photographic instrument to take good photographs than most people (including me) have talents to take good pictures. I dont think that in my lifetime I will ever exhaust the possibilities that this simple lens can offer!.

If your interest in photography goes beyond point-and-shoot, there's no better place to start than with a high-quality 50 mm lens like this one - especially at the price. It's no fault of the lens that it doesn't autofocus on the the D60 and D40.

The pictures at f/1.4 look like you are looking through a sheer veil. A dreamy look for sure, but not at all pleasing. At an aperture of f/1.8 the 50mm f/1.8 is still sharper than the 50mm f/1.4 at f/1.8. It isn't until the 50mm f/1.4 is at f/2.8 that the two lenses have similar sharpness. At no aperture was the 50mm f/1.4 better than the 50mm f/1.8. Why spend so much more money for the 50mm f/1.4, when it is so soft at f/1.4 as to be useless and does not match the sharpness of the 50mm f/1.8? Softness at f/1.4 will also affect the ability of your camera to autofocus correctly because the lens autofocuses with its widest aperture. If the autofocus sees a soft image, you'll have problems getting a focus lock. The 50mm f/1.8 works like magic on the D50/D70/D200 cameras. Trust me..

You stop it back to even f/2.8 and any complaints will be gone with the wind while still providing you with a razor-thin DOF.My biggest concern with this lens before receiving it was the little aperture ring. I wasn't around back in the day of manually setting f-stops, so I was concerned that I would have to manually adjust it. This was not the case, however.

After several years of use with film and DX bodies, I am now using it with a D700 and I am consistently amazed at the image quality, contrast, and low-light capabilities of this lens. Despite it's low price, it's well-constructed and can handle rough use. The low weight makes it much more enjoyable to carry around all day instead of a big super-zoom, and the compact size is far less intimidating to subjects.This lens really shines in dim lighting conditions. The relatively fast glass makes ambient light photography possible in conditions I would have never tried previously.

I had to use three different 4-port USB devices and daisy-chain them together (which caused me to waste two ports just in connecting them to each other!)This product, however, did the same amount of work as my three 4-port USB hubs for 1/3 the cost, 1/3 the hassle, and 1/3 the power cables taking up socket space on my power strip.Not only is this 7-port d-link more efficient, there is one other key difference.  The ports are vertical instead of horizontal.  This means that it takes a lot less space than an equivalent 7-port horizontal hub.  Why is this? Because it is more efficient use of space.  As a result, you can ALWAYS fit your USB microdrive in the usb slot without crowing out a neighboring slot.  Sometimes the USB keychain drives are too wide, and it is difficult to insert one into a hub without pressing into the USB item next to it.  With the slots being vertical, instead of horizontal, this is never a problem.One more thing, the power adapter is pretty small, and it is a "sideways" adapter.  This means that with optimal placement you might just be able to place it where you only cover one wall socket on your power outlet/power strip.I am very happy with this purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone who needs more than one four port USB hub.  I'll never go back to the 4-porter again....

I looked into what changed with the USB spec, and here's the important skinny:Standard power allowances:USB 2.0 devices are allowed up to 500mA per port.USB 3.0 devices are allowed up to 900mA per port.Two new "special ports" have been defined in USB 3.0 / Battery Spec 1.2:USB DCP - Dedicated Charging Port - provides up to 5A but disallows data.USB CDP - Charging Downstream Port - provides up to 1.5A and data at the same time.This hub provides the 900mA per port that my hard drives require, and I now have three drives running without any "device drawing too much power" error messages. By virtue of USB 3.0 &lt;-> 2.0 compatibility, my host computer is USB 2.0 and connects to the 3.0 hub and 3.0 devices (obviously limited to 2.0 speed, but that's fine, it's the power that I needed).Side note: I looked at the DUB-H7 again, and there's a new version (all black) that has icons indicating that the two far-right ports might be CDP ports.

I was skittish because I had purchased two other USB hubs (granted, rather cheap ones) before that, and both had failed within a couple of months. So when I bought this one, I spent extra to get a 2-year warranty to go along with it. I was determined that if this thing failed, by gum, I was going to be covered!I needn't have worried. I plugged the thing in as soon as it arrived, and it worked flawlessly from then until now, more than four years later, when it's still working perfectly.I guess I wasted my money buying that warranty.The product works so well for me that I'm buying another one to use with my new Apple Time Capsule combo wireless router/network hard drive (it has a USB port and I'm hoping to be able to connect two printers and two exernal hard drives to be able to get to through my network).This USB hub has worked flawlessly with my PC, and while I can't testify as to whether it will work as well with a Mac yet because I haven't tried it, how different can it be? USB is USB, right?By the way, if you're considering a USB hub, you might want to spend the bit of extra money to get a powered hub. Some USB devices (like portable hard drives) draw their power through the USB connection, and if you have an un-powered hub, they will then draw their power from your computer's USB port (through the hub).I'm happy with this product.

I use it with a USB-powered external hard drive, an iPhone 4, digital camera, keyboard, and mouse. The older hub is connected to a PC, the newer one to a Mac Mini. Both the iPhone and external hard drive draw significant amounts of power, but the external transformer supplies plenty of juice.The product description says the hub will work when self-powered, but I always use it with the external transformer.My only complaint is that the external transformer is kind of large, so it may cover adjacent plugs when plugged into a power strip.Update May 31 2011: I just upgraded my Mac Mini to an iMac, and the hub has problems with it. After the iMac comes out of standby, devices connected to the hub are disconnected or hung. You can see in Apple's discussion forums that this is a common problem with the D-Link hub on iMac and Macbook.

But other than that the device works really well. I will be updating this review later.*UPDATE*Ok so now we have had this switch for I think 2 months now and not 1... NOT 1! problem what so ever. Never had a problem, it works everyday with out fail. I never had to re-boot it, I also got a netgear n600 router when I got this and only had to re-boot it twice in 2 months, which is a HUGE improvement over my old cisco linksys router which needed re-booted quite often. The only thing that I noticed with the switch is that it gets very hot.. VERY HOT, we usually have 6 things connected to the switch at once, 3-4 being gigabit. Compared to the fs105 that used to run my network this switch gets incredible hot, especially when other network gear that also gets quite hot is on top of it. I could not even keep my hand on it for very long it was so hot, but that ahs not yet been a problem, nothing has shut down or quit due to over-heating.

I connected it to the Surfboard modem my cable co. provided, piece of cake. I used the included CD, set up a WPA key and was surfing within about ten minutes. The only time I had a problem is when I upgraded to Dell Support Center 2.0 (I got a "problem applying profile" message), but when I uninstalled Support Center that went away.

Was attempting to connect this router to my ISP's router which some reviewers had success in doing with cross over cables and static ip's.  Unfortunately I wasn't one of them.  3 days lost messing with this and Linksys tech support was really weak.  I knew more than they did about their product.  To quote one 'tech' &quot;I'm confused&quot;...duh!  I'm convinced all the calls went to some outsourcer in India to boot so getting through was an ordeal in itself.If you have a very simple setup and don't care too much about security you may be very happy with this.

I've have had fairly little trouble with it. Prior to purchasing this, I unknowingly thought that I already had a router. Because my second (wireless) computer was picking up a connection with a Netgear adapter. But (I have since learned) that must have been a neighbor's because I only had a Westell modem from Verizon that did not come with a router.This router was a little tricky hooking up. Verizon walked me through it, though. Actually, I only purchased this brand because Verizon told me that they would not provide tech support if I purchased another manufacturer's brand. I suppose that doesn't matter too much because Linksys was the least expensive. I was on the phone with Verizon for over an hour until it was set up.A couple of months ago, I completely lost a connection on my wireless computer. I called Netgear (the manufacturer of my adapter) and was told to call Linksys. Linksys was helpful, although it was difficult to understand them because they were located in India. The Linksys associate told me that my connection was erased because of a bad storm (does anyone else think this is an odd explanation?) and she did walk me through setting up a new wireless network from the adapter to the router.Since my wireless computer has been set up I have had no difficulty keeping a connection. Every once in a while I will lose a connection (on my wireless computer) and usually if I turn my router on and off my wireless computer will regain a connection. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone that has a second computer like myself for nonessential matters.It seems like none of these companies (Verizon, Linksys and Netgear) train their employees to "think outside the box." That is very frustering and disapointing. They all acted like it was unusual for someone to have 2 desktops in their home. They always automatically assumed that one of my computers was a laptop. And, when they found out that I had AOL they also found this to be odd. I was being looked down on because I had a second computer with AOL hooked up to it. It's like checking into a Marriott Hotel and paying cash; you know that look the hourly desk clerk gives? One gentleman even sarcastically said, "AOL is infested with bugs." But it isn't any of their business what software I choose to have on my computers. Because, they should be trained to welcome all customers no matter what situation their customer is in. Another thing I learned is that you should always speak up. Always ask questions, no matter how foolish you may think it is. That is what they are there for!.

For example, the Netgear WGR614 was a nightmare to deal with, often becoming non-functional as soon as a network device other than a PC was connected onto the network (ie. network printer). Netgear's tech support was also puzzled by the numerous network errors. The Belkin routers in general perform better than the Netgear but still suffer from the need to reboot itself about once every two weeks.Pair this router with a Linksys extender (read the reviews for the Linksys extender for setup help as the included documentation is horrible) and your home network is good to go..

My field is software engineering (big surprise) and I am a self-professed gadget freak. So my experience may not be the same as that of the average novice, but I think that if you're going wireless, you've already got some computer time under your belt.The install was painless and quick. I should mention that all the PCs that I connected to it are XPs. And really, if you're running WinNT or Win98 or WinME, then you should really be spending your money elsewhere instead of trying to drag that thing into the 21st century. :-)Performance-wise this unit performs flawlessly. I have it set up in my basement (a less than ideal location for a wireless router) and I can still connect to my network using my laptop from my neighbor's backyard (a good 50 feet away through several layers of sheetrock and a 6&quot; concrete foundation). All in all, excellent reception. I live a block away from the park where my son plays in little league (approximately 1/4 mile away) and I can still detect my network via NetStumbler (but I can't connect to it). I'm going to try placing a repeater up in the attic to see if I can't connect from the park and give the grandparents some live video feed...A word on Linksys tech support. It sucks. Fortunately, it has been my experience that a call to tech support is almost never required. This may have been my good luck or perhaps some early karma, but either way, dealing with them sucks, but they make a darn good product and you most likely will not have to deal with them. I'm not a Linksys apologist at all. They *should* have at least adequate tech support. But 'bang for the buck'-wise, they are well worth the money. And besides, do a Google on 'Linksys' and you'll find a gazillion websites detailing installs, common tech support issues, etc..I would've given this product 5 stars, but I'm currently having some difficulty setting up WPA (as opposed to WEP) and am not exactly loving life right now. It's probably something I'm doing wrong, but it *should* be easier.Cheers,Ed T..

I used Microsoft wireless router before. Because I think I can't stant too many home networking setup. But previous one broken so I have to seek a new replacement. I check out PC magazine for product advice. So I narrow down to two product: one is this model another one is MN-700 from Microsoft. I didnt know which one is better so I walked into bestbuy to see these two. But I wasn't lucky to see them both. They are hot product. MN-700 sold out. Linksys has router but no USB adapter. I need router right away and can't wait for no service at all. So I asked sales for advice to pick USB adapter from Netgear whom said these two compatable. I thought it good to try. So I brought back with Linksys router and Netgear USB adapter. What amazing day. First, I opened box from Linksys and read thru. the instruction. Following the step 1,2,3... everything just plug-in and play. After install software from CD then plug in router and then let installation wizard guide me through the installation process. This is first time in my life without any error and trying. This product rock and no problem at all. I install this router with laptop at window 2000. And use cable modem service. Next I have to work on my remote site on desktop PC. Once again, I opened box from netgear and no problem again to install on my PC with window XP pro. Netgear did pick up frequency from Linksys which my old one,MN-51 from microsoft couldn't. So now my home networing blazing thru the whole house. I have another laptop whith Wi-Fi also pick up the frequency from Linksys. All I can say is this product's performance way over my expect before.1. Very easy to install. As long as I follow the instruction. Just like step 1,2,3.2. Great product for non-experience person like me. It seek setting info. for me from PC. The reason I say this is because my laptop need to connect back to office too. Needed to go through security company firewall... If it couldn't catch the setting for me, I will have problem to find those setting.3.

Linksys has really cheapened the WRT54G and WRT54GS routers with less flash memory and less RAM and a new embedded operating system.Router acted flaky right out of the box.  Went into the web interface and discovered that the interface was in German.  Flashed the firmware to the latest revision thinking that would fix the language issue.  It did not.  Do a Google and you will see this is a known problem with the this version.So off to Big Box Mart to exchange the router with an identical one.  At least the replacement worked.  Web interface was in English as expected.  Using IE7 and discovered an issue with the web interface though.  Was not able to set up MAC address filtering as the interface would not refresh correctly.  Used another laptop with IE6 and was able to set up MAC address filtering.My advice:  Avoid the new WRT54G and WRT54GS routers like the plague.

Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device. They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5. They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time. Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices. Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done. If it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue, explain it to us so we don't have to theorize on the motives.In the mean time, I'll buy a different router like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).

Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. But everything worked out for the best.After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo. Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm. The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g. However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity..

No issues whatsoever.If you have a portable, I recommend buying the linksys wireless G card if you really want the performance/ease of setup I experienced.  There is a risk using other cards.  For instance, I borrowed a friend's compaq tablet PC with an 802.11b internal wireless card and I couldn't get it working without disabling WEP.  The tablet PC also had to be in same room as the router to get signal.  I believe this was more a problem with tablet PC internal wireless card than it was with this router.

I played with the antennae and other settings (firewall, etc) but none of them alleviated the problem. The airport software was up to date and giving me three out of four bars as a signal indicator, so software / the Airport Extreme card wasn't the issue.Some people download third party firmware that circumvents the signal strength limiter but I wasn't about to do anything that might void the warranty and thus my ability to return it.

Maybe Linksys already has the latest firmware on the devices now.I was using a cable modem -> netgear router which centrally links to every room in my house. This wireless router gave my enough wired ports to still have one wired desktop connection in most of the rooms and add wireless capabilities for my laptop.

I've also tried no encryption, WEP encryption, 128bit etc and they all work just flawlessly.I got a better price from amazon along with the rebate ($58 -$10 rebate), so I guess it's a good deal.Before buying this, I researched on 802.11b, g, with speedbooster, and D-Link Xtreme G(108Mbps).- speedbooster wasn't an option since it needed a compatible wireless card (tight dependency)- G(54Mbps) was a better choice than B(11Mbps)since it was quite polular and backwards compatible- xtreme-G (108Mbps) was quite new and it seems like it was D-Link specific only.Plus, since I also stream music over wireless from different computers and I needed something more that 11Mbps and G works just fine.Overall, a great buy and the next upgrade will be when 108Mbps becomes more standard on wireless..

Now I know that basically, wireless is wireless and 99.9% of all routers probably work with Macs OK. But BEFORE I purchased I called LinkSys just to be sure and I was told very politely by an AMERICAN CS rep that YES, ALL LinkSys routers are compatible with Macs and that if I have any trouble simply call customer service and they'll walk you through.So I bought it. Got home, opened it up, hooked it up and just for s**ts and giggles I started up Firefox (Internet Browser) and I had internet.Now hold on. It wasn't really right. I still had to configure the router and I couldn't access the router's home page.  I knew this would happen. No big deal.  I called LinkSys and within five minutes a wonderful young lady by the name of Roxanne had all of my settings straightened out.Now I know that this isn't really a big deal. Or isn't it?  I was going to buy Apple's Airport Extreme. The price tag didn't bother me. But do you know what did? No tech support  unless your have an active extra care plan on your computer.

See my other reviews for the details.  I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.  This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.  I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.The new linksys set up immediately.  I ran my speed test program and was able to get 2400+ kbytes/second thruput with the linksys, using 64 bit WEP encryption, all with less than 5% CPU.  That's more than 4x the best speed I was able to get with the 802.11B device with encryption turned OFF!I use the device more like a wireless hub, not in router mode, since my internet connection is no where near the middle of the house where I want the wireless access point to be.  I had one problem after I upgraded the firmware which I think was caused by some important parameter in the device being changed after the upgrade.  I am not sure about it.  I had to go back up into the attic and connect with a wire before I could get it working again.Oh, and don't ever do what I did: do not ever upgrade the firmware over a wireless connection!  What I was thinking I do not know - I am lucky I didn't lose the connection halfway through and render the device useless.This device never drops connections, so I stay logged into Windows Messenger continuously.Great product, no problems.

Another 5 star performance. Having never hooked up a wireless network before, I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit, and used their included CD. They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right. Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, I decided to do it that way right out of the box. I'm glad I did. This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time. Shutting off what they tell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install. Not even one glitch. The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install. Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house. No Wires !Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room. When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps. Let's get a perspective here. A standard modem works at 56K tops. This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte. Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte. So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem. I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download end, and 100 to 150 upload speed. I know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card. What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies. As soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast. The operating system is Windows XP. Installation was as near automatic as can be. They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment. Follow the directions exactly. It is easy.

The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server. Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.The only issue I am having is that I can no longer use my 2.4mhz corless phone. Every time I turn it on it kills my network connection. But my 900mhz phone works fine.10/31/02 - I noticed that Linksys has a new version of this router out(1.1) I was curious to know what the difference was and went out and purchased it. The looks of the router itself are different, less flashing lights and the Cicso logo. Functionally however there is a huge difference. The long range has improved greatly, I get about an extra 20 feet of range than I did with the 1.0 version. Also, I have not had a dropped signal since I hooked it up about 1 month ago. This version also has an SPI firewall as well as more security options for the wireless client.My adivce to you is that if you are looking to purchase this router, make sure you pick up the 1.1 version! And before you begin using it, after you get it out of the box, press the reset button to make sure it is back to the factory default setting,  go to linksys's website and update the firmware to 1.42.2.

I use any number of methods to do that, and one that is used frequently is a headset. I have gone through a number of headsets over the years, some expensive ones - some cheap ones. This Panasonic KX-TCA60 is a great little headset that is extremely inexpensive, but does the job very well.WHAT I LIKE:-  Light weight. So light, that you don't notice it on much at all. This is important if you're on a 4 hour conference call!-  Comfortable ear pad. The leather(ish) padded ear pad is like those found on much more expensive sets. It provides long-term comfort and also gives you agood seal so that you hear the call clearly.-  Good quality mic. After using this headset on several business calls, I asked some people how it sounded. They said I sounded perfect - nice and clear.The mic boom is bendable and it swivels, so it is easy to find the perfect spot for it and move it as necessary. The windscreen is nice too, and helpsyour voice sound good.-  Sound quality is very good. I am able to clearly hear the other person(s) on the call very well, with a nice rich tone to their voices - not tinny sounding.-  Good cord length. The cord is long enough to allow comfortable movement after you set the phone down. It also has a clip that you can use to attach toyour shirt to prevent the "pulled the headset off my head" accident from happening.-  The 90 degree connector is good - it minimizes the amount sticking out from the phone, and you can swivel it to get optimal cord direction.-  Does not pinch. There is so little pressure against your head that you can wear it all day. I've had some that give me a headache after a couple hoursbecause they have too much tension.WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED:-  Really just one thing - the fitting of the headset is made for larger heads. I wear it at the smallest possible setting and it *barely* fits right.It fits... but just barely. Meanwhile, it expands enough to go on a pumpkin. I'd like to see a notch or two the other way for smaller heads.I purchased this headset for under $10. At that price it is top notch. I would take away 1/2 star for the sizing factor, but I won't remove a whole star for that... so.... five stars!.

I immediately called Panasonic and they said to ignore what the package said and that this unit is indeed compatible with my Panasonic 5.8 GHz phone.So Panasonic... why not put this very important information on the package????This unit works well with both our 5.8 GHz (WHEW..) and 2.4 GHz wireless phones (but not our Nokia 6010 cell).  I have a problem hearing on the phone, and the sound with the headset is excellent.  I've been told by the people that I've talked to while wearing the headset, that my voice is very clear - as is their's.I can't stand having anything on my head, so this feels a little tight, even after adjusting it, but hopefully I'll get used to it.  My husband's set is very comfortable for him.  I didn't give it five stars because I can't wear my glasses with it ... it smooshed the ear piece on my glasses and I had to have them professionally re-adjusted. Since I don't need my glasses to hear - this shouldn't be a problem!I feel like a Time-Life operator when I'm wearing it..

The prime factor takes a little getting used to, since you have to move yourself rather than zooming, but it really doesn't take long to adjust your thinking.  The image quality is great in all lighting situations: the wide open aperture gives you the flexibility to get good results in low light if necessary.  The aperture will also take your portraits to the next level (a lower f/ number will blur more of the background).  In fact, I rarely shoot at the widest aperture (even for food photography), but it's nice to have the option.  The construction of the lens seems very sturdy: heavy enough to add a little heft to the camera body, but in no way a burden to carry around for long periods of time.If I had to recommend just one lens purchase to take your DSLR photos to the next level, this would certainly be it..

Maybe because of my technical background I started testing my own lenses quite a while ago. I have a (no longer so) little test lab of my own where I do 6 different image quality tests (after taking a lens out for a while).The EF 50mm f/1.4 USM is Canon's medium-budget 50 mm prime lens that combines good image quality with a compact and lightweight form factor. It has a precise USM motor that allows manual override during autofocus operation but it's an older generation model that's a little slower and noisier than modern USM motors. The lens is solidly built but of the outer parts only the lens mount is made of metal. The very low f-stops available (good maximum aperture) make this lens ideal for available light photography and portraits. Due to its high resolution at higher f-stops it's also suitable for landscapes (not so much on APS-C cameras where the effective focal length is 80 mm). Even wide open the EF 50mm f/1.4 USM has an impressive resolution but color fringes ("chromatic abberrations") both in focused ("transverse CA") and in blurred ("axial CA") parts of the images are a problem with this lens. Distortion is also an issue if the lens is used with a full frame camera. While corner shadow ("vignetting") is present it does fade with higher f-stops (narrower apertures) and there is no curvature of the focal plane ("field curvature"). The aperture shape is circular and creates even-looking bokeh.The EF 50mm f/1.4 USM costs more than three times as much as theEF 50mm f/1.8 IIbut (unlike the high-end offeringEF 50mm f/1.2L USM) is still affordable for most. The surcharge is paid for a better autofocus motor, higher built quality, a properly sized focus ring and of course a better maximum aperture of f/1.4 rather than f/1.8. I would have hoped that the image quality were also a step upwards but it's very similar to theEF 50mm f/1.8 II(which is probably good enough anyway). In real-life applications however the EF 50mm f/1.4 USM will likely deliver better images just for its superior focusing operation. If you are on a tight budget you'll be more than happy with the lower-cost offering but if you can easily afford it the EF 50mm f/1.4 USM will be a nicer lens to use.A much more detailed review of this lens together with all test shots, sample images and technical data is available on my website LensTests_com..

A[fter some additional research and reading of reviews, I decided to cough up the money for the 1.4 lens and I am very happy I did this.While the 1.8 lens seemed to be a good lens (aside from the dirt inside), the 1.4 is sharper, takes in more light, and is also more responsive. Not to mention the precise distance control. You can do great indoor pictures without ever using the flash and you end up with nice crisp pictures without the harsh effects of the flash. VERY impressive.The 1.4 lens is also much more sturdy (nice metal body) than the 1.8 plastic lightweight. Even if the dirt had not been inside the lens, I would have been tempted to send the 1.8 lens back because it felt too light and fragile.All in all, I am happy that I ended up spending the additional $250 on this lens.

At f/2.8 however, my Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 fixed aperture zoom was just as sharp as this lens. I soon found the 50mm to be too restricting on a rebel xt and returned it. I bought the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 instead, and it is really the ideal 50mm for crop cameras. I am aware of quality issues with the Sigma and the fact that it is a DC lens, but its worth every penny if you manage to get a good copy. Unless you exclusively take portrait shots, or are switching to full frame pretty soon, this lens is always going to keep you feeling limited. Pair the sigma up with the cheaper 50mm f/1.8 and you will have an excellent pair of lens to start off with.A suggestion to all large aperture lens users. It is best to set the focus point to center only, focus on the object and then frame the shot. Using multiple focus points in the f/1.4-2.0 range is asking for trouble.Current list of lens I use with my Rebel XT (never bought the kit lens):Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 (wide angle/general purpose shooting)Sigma 30mm f/1.4 (low light, DOF shots)Canon 50mm f/1.8 II (portrait)Sigma 70-300 f/3.5-5.6 APO Macro (occasional macro/telephoto).

I can't use flash so I am forced many times to use MF. It is however very well built not L series well built but compared to the F.8 version it is a tank. It is also crystal clear too.

The lens is nicely constructed, and feels well made in the hand.  The focus ring is fairly wide and very smooth in its motion.  The only control on the lens itself is the auto focus/manual focus switch.  The lens doesn't ship with a hood, but the front element is set fairly deep so you most likely won't need one anyway.  I've shot with Canon's cheaper 50mm f/1.8 before and this lens is clearly superior in build quality and materials.I shoot with the lens on my 7D, and in use it is quick to focus, and very quiet in doing so.  When shooting at f/1.4 - f/1.8 I find about 90% of the photos have the subject perfectly in focus.  Since the aperture is so wide this is probably a mix of camera error and/or my moving forward or backward slightly when taking the photo.  The depth of field is so narrow at that aperture, it's easy to see how this could be the case.  Regardless, those wide apertures are what allow me to even take photos in such low-light conditions (such as my recent trip to Walt Disney World at night) so I'm happy to deal with a couple of off shots.  Sharpness from f/1.4 to f/2.0 is decent, but a bit soft, especially the corners.  Once you hit f/2.0 the lens sharpens up quite nicely, and missed focus is rarely a problem.  On a crop sensor camera, like my 7D, the field of view is equivalent to 80mm so it's quite a tight view, but it's easy to adjust to after a few shots (just don't plan on using the lens in tight quarters).  Lastly, I don't notice any vingetting with the lens, and distortion is low.All in all... a must for all Canon DSLR owners..

Takes incredible portraits. Perfect for kids since its a very fast lens. I found that it performs best at 2.8-3.2 f range. Otherwise you get blur and have to shoot at very high speeds. I use it with my canon t2i. It is a prime lens, so you have to be prepared to move around to get the shot you want, at 50mm you have to be a few feet back if you want to get more than the face and shoulders. Compared to my other telephoto L lens (which was much much more money) this lens is great value. I'm sure if I had the EF 1.2 lens I would be happier, but this is a great lens for the money. I opted not to go with the cheaper f1.8 lens even though I heard they're similar in Photo quality. I never shoot at f1.4 because almost everything is blurred, so I don't really know how they both perform side-by-side at f3.2. but I certainly don't regret going with the 1.4 lens.update 6/2014 - had a problem with the focus barrel and was unable to focus on objects closer than 2 feet. did some research and found youtube videos on how to fix it yourself but was disappointed to find out that  this is a common problem with this lens in heavy use. someone put it as "you never really own this lens, you pay a downpayment then payments every few years to send it in for canon to repair". it cost $80 for canon to repair the mechanical issues, but I took it apart and was able to get it working again with help from youtube, but likely will need to send in for a new barrel (could buy part myself $35).

Fast!I shoot a lot of indoor sports, no flash, and I just couldn't do it without the 1.4, keeping it at 1.4-1.8. Even on my Xti, I just bump the ISO to 800, and I can freeze the action. Nothing comes close to this, at this price.This camera also offers a stunningly shallow depth of field when you want it. Of course, this means you have to be extra alert to where you are focusing.I recently bought a 28-135, so that I could zoom in on my daughters soccer games, and to be able to take wider indoor shots. A great lens, but when I took it to a night game, it just wasn't fast enough, and any movement was blurry. Not a worry for the 1.4 of the 50mm.My only caveat... as I alluded to in the above paragraph, it's not wide enough for kitchen/living room pics, on a cropped sensor. At least, not for anything more than a profile pic.Two more points:1) Remember, this is not a zoom. So what you see is what you get, you can not zoom in on someone, to take a candid picture. You'll have to get close enough for them to notice you. Cropping in post will only get you so far.2) If you want to save some money, the 50mm 1.8 is unquestionably the best bang for your buck. If you decide you don't want to spend this much for a prime, at least get the 1.8. I have a huge library of beautiful pics from that lens, and it also did a great job at freezing the action in poor lighting. (Why jump to the 1.4 then?

The 1.4 & 1.8 are regarded highly relative to their cost.  A major difference between the two is overall quality of the build.  The less expensive 1.8 is very light and uses a plastic mount, no distance window and an older, slower, AF motor.  What I like about the 1.4 is, while it is light, it feels more solid, uses a quieter ultrasonic focus motor, has a distance window, more aperture blades and a more durable metal mount.

Prior to buying, I did a considerable amount of research and recall reading comments that this was the favorite lens of many photographers. It has become my favorite as well.My primary questions at the time I bought were: 1) Do I need a 50mm since my zoom lens covers the 50mm focal range? 2) If I do need a 50mm, why not just by the f/1.8 at a fraction of the price?As to the first question, I don't "need" this lens unless I want to be able to take tack sharp photos in low light without using a flash. That's the capability it delivers. In my case, I like to photograph dogs and shooting a flash in their face just isn't the way to go so having this lens makes all the difference. In brighter lighting this lens delivers remarkably fast shutter speeds and gives me the option of shooting photos with beautiful bokeh. For those new to photography, that's the area in the photo that is out of focus.The second question is harder to answer because I have never owned the f/1.8. I've been pleased with Canon equipment so I assume it is a good quality product. The difference in speed is significant; the f/1.4 lets in nearly twice the light as f/1.8. One thing I've learned is you pay dearly for speed!The MTF data for both lenses is available on the Canon website and the Luminous Landscape website has a tutorial on how to read MTF data. I'm sure there are others but they use the 50mm f/1.4 MTF chart as the example so half your work is done for you.As for reliability, I haven't had a problem with the lens. However, any product can have problems so I always buy using my Amazon VISA which doubles the manufactures warranty at no cost. You don't have to do anything except keep your receipt. If you want more detail just call the 800 number on the card. They also sell extended warranties at a very low price. I don't buy them, however, because I figure if it works for 2 years its probably going to be fine.I've noticed that while the price of Cameras tends to decline but the price of a good lens tends to hold or go up. I could sell this lens used for more than I paid for it a couple of years ago. I'm not interested in selling however. This is the only f/1.4 lens I will ever be able to afford and the last lens I would consider selling. I love it!.

The shots we outrageously soft.  So soft every shot looked poor and out of focus.  Whether the kid was shooting a foul shot (not moving) or racing down the court (moving fast) the show was terrible.  After some research on this lens ( google Canon f1.4 wide open softness ) you'll see many people agree the f1.4 classification is more of marketing value than photo value.

It is unbelievably sharp. I shoot it indoor at F2.8, 1/90, and ISO 200 most of the time (5D3). The key here is to get a Speedlite 270EXII and spend time to learn how to use it well. Pictures are incredibly detailed. BTW, spend a couple of hours micro-adjusting the focus. I had to set this at -12 to get the sharpest images.2. It is just the right size and weight. Most lenses are just too big, bulky, and heavy for general purpose use. I also tried the Canon 40mm F2.8 pancake. Great lens, but actually too small and didn't feel right. This 50mm is just right.3. Good focal length. On my 5D3 (full frame) I feel like 35mm is too wide, and 85mm is too tight in *most* general purpose situations. Again, the 50mm is just right for the vast majority of situations.I know a lot of people are wondering if they should get the F1.8 or F1.2 instead of the F1.4. I too agonized over this. I had the F1.8 prior to this, and while that is a great lens, it just feels too cheap on a 5D3. If money is really tight, or you just want to experiment, go with the F1.8. If you want something you'll use a lot (like me) go with the F1.4. As for the F1.2, I think it makes sense if you are a professional and need that extra tiny amount of capability. However, for that tiny amount of extra capability between F1.2 and F2.0, you are paying an extra $1000 and getting a much bulkier lens. My advice is to shoot at F2.8 and learn how to use your Speedlite well. Spend the money you save on a Speedlite 270EXII and a 5D2 or 5D3..

But, an unusable camera (due to dust) is unusable - so I decided it was time to actually try it.  And it wasn't so bad.It was pretty nerve racking, but it was fairly easy.I used a staged approach and I bought all the stuff - the blower, the brush, and the swabs.  I went through each method and it was just like you read in the other reviews.  The blower took off some, the brush took off more, and the swab got all the rest.I was pretty pleased with the blower even though it didn't even come close to removing all the dust.  It is light years ahead of the little weenie blowers you get in camera cleaning kits.  It is not a replacement for actually cleaning the sensor, but it works as a good preventative measure to blow dust out of your chamber and to blow the loose stuff off of your sensor.Overall, it is a pretty good buy and I would definitely buy it again..

Think again, as it's far too big for that (unless I buy a bigger bag)!So, I keep it at home, and use it regularly.  It creates a tremendous movement of air, so it's fine for blowing off dust particles and other small pieces of debris that collect on the camera lens, and other places.  I keep a UV filter permanently in place on my lenses, but dust gets underneath even so, and so this blower comes in handy for regular cleaning.  As other people have observed, this device won't remove everything, so you should still invest in a cleaning brush if you want to be able to clean your camera and lens properly.I've noticed a lot of comments about whether or not you should clean your camera's sensor, and I will add my two cents for what they're worth.  I'd be very careful with regard to blowing air into the camera's innerds, whether it be by the use of this product, or when using a spray can (and you should be ultra careful when using the latter at all times because little dabs of propellant could come out and you don't want those inside your precious camera's inner workings).Most definitely do not stick the nozzle of this device right inside the camera body where it could touch sensitive parts like the mirror, shutter, or sensor.  Keep a respectful distance when dealing with such components.This is a great product, and it does exactly what it's designed to do &#8211; no more, no less.  I'd recommend it to anybody..

There is also the more compactGiottos AA1920 Rocket Air Blaster Small (Black), but I find the larger and more forceful volume of air that is blown by the Medium-sized and Large-sized Rocket Airs to be more useful, requiring fewer blasts of air to get the job done.  These are the best air blowers on the market!  My Rocket Airs are still going strong after several years of near-daily usage, so I recommend this highly for both effectiveness and durability.  Don't just settle for the tiny blowers that come in the camera cleaning kits; those tiny blowers are far more compact and easy to carry, but they cannot do much to dislodge stubborn electrostatically-charged dust.After I decide upon what I am packing, traveling with, or what camera bag or backpack I am carrying, I then decide whether to take my medium or large Rocket Air for the outing.  And one of my large Rocket Airs always stays at home for a variety of non-camera uses too.  I usually travel with the medium-sized Rocket Air because it is more compact.  For cleaning camera sensors on my three Canon dSLRs, I use the large-sized Rocket Air because I want a good blast of air without inserting the Blaster's nozzle into the camera body.  I do not want to get the Rocket Air's nozzle too close to my camera's sensor for fear of bumping the plastic nozzle tip onto the sensor.These are indispensable not just for cleaning off camera lenses and sensors, but I also use them to blow out dust and debris that may collect on computer keyboards and laptops, every time I open up a desktop computer case to change the computer's internal configuration, and various other uses where I need to blow dust off of electronic components.For cleaning keyboards and laptops at home, where I have access to a vacuum cleaner with crevice tool available, the vacuum crevice tool is more effective than this air blower.  But while I am at the office or on the road, I use the Rocket Air on keyboards and laptops.Another awesome use for my Rocket Air is for blowing dust off of computer and electronic components. In particular, it is important to periodically blow dust off of the heat sinks of electronics such as CPU heat sinks and heat sinks inside stereo amplifiers/receivers. Heat sinks that have heavy amounts of accumulated dust can lead to ineffective heat dissipation, resulting in the overheating of your CPU and electronics, possibly leading to premature component failure. Even if I have not upgraded my desktop computers within a year, I like to open up the cases of all of my desktop computers once a year and blow out the dust that accumulates on the CPU heat sink, the motherboard, all internal computer fans, and I point the Rocket Air's nozzle into the slots of my computer's power supply to blow dust out of it too. As with cleaning digital camera sensors, you should not get the Rocket Air's nozzle too close to the motherboard to avoid risking the nozzle getting bumped into sensitive components. If you have a desktop computer and you have not opened up the computer case in years, you may be surprised at just how much dust, pet fur, and debris has accumulated on its motherboard, CPU, components, power supply, fan blades, etc. It only takes a few minutes to open up the computer case, take the Rocket Air, and blow all that dust out of the motherboard, power supply, and fans. You may also want to have a vacuum cleaner nearby to suck up the cloud of dust that comes floating out.You should also periodically clean the vent openings on your laptop.  These vent openings consist of fan intake vents and vents where warm air from inside your laptop is blown out.  These vent openings may be positioned around the sides of the laptop and also underneath the laptop.  Dust and lint can be pulled into the interior of a laptop, causing ineffective heat dissipation and overheating.  And compared to the interior of a desktop computer, a laptop's interior is far more crowded.  When I have access to a vacuum cleaner's crevice tool, I find that holding the vacuum crevice tool up close to a laptop's vents is more effective for cleaning them.  But when I am at the office or traveling, I point this Rocket Air's nozzle up against each of the laptop's vent openings and give each vent opening several good blasts of air.  By cleaning the interior of your desktop computers and laptops, your computer runs more efficiently to cool itself and you may even notice that your computer's fans run quieter because they do not have to try as hard to cool the computer when the interior is not all covered with dust and lint.For years now, I no longer buy any of the canister "air duster" products anymore.  And despite being referred to as "canned air", these "air" canisters all consist of fluorocarbons that are compressed into liquid form, and fluorocarbons are toxic, noxious, and flammable.  And if you do not hold and use the "air duster" cans correctly, they can spray liquid fluorocarbons onto your camera's sensor or electronic components.  A common fluorocarbon used in "canned air" is difluoroethane.  Prolonged exposure to difluoroethane has been linked in humans to the development of coronary heart-disease and angina; the chemical can also cause lower abdominal cramps.  Many fluorocarbons are very potent greenhouse gases that can affect the environment, and if some fluorocarbons are inhaled/ingested, like pesticides, they can accumulate and be stored in your body to have toxic effects on your liver and endocrine and immune systems.  So these canned air products, which are really canned fluorocarbons, are all nasty stuff... both for you and the environment.  Along with being more healthy for you by not breathing fluorocarbons into your lungs when you use canned air products, your hand muscles also get a little exercise by squeezing this Rocket Air :)The large Rocket Air also comes in a red color if you prefer that color.  As an added bonus, I love the Rocket Air design, looking like a Buck Rogers spacecraft, with its four rocket fins cleverly keeping the blower free-standing upright on a table.  Visitors to your house might initially think that this Rocket Air device is some kind of proctologist tool or kinky sex toy, but that adds to its charm!  If you have a dog, keep your Rocket Air away from them, as some dogs find this to be a pretty nice chew toy! :-). The summary for the 37649 is This thing really blows!

They feel like wearing drywall.What really makes me hate this product is the unit's propensity to produce sudden and high volume noise without me moving my head.

I'm a retired electrical engineer, and nothing to do the whole day that's why I tried to fix it rather than return it to Amazon.  I'm very satisfied with this headphones' stereo sound, and the low hissing sound is not present as soon as the music started.  It's a little heavy and bulky, and it will constantly slide downward whenever I bend down to pick up something on the floor.  I solved this problem that other users complained about.  I tied an old and clean shoelace at the back of the headhpones plastic bands, making sure that the slack is long enough to looop around the back of my head.  I hope Sennheiser will redesign this superb sounding headphones, and improve their quality control in China before they put their well known German brand name on this model of headphones.

The base station plugs into a headphone port on the TV. See comment above on setting the volume levels, before you conclude that the headphones are noisy.I did have to charge overnight before the headphones were usable out of the box. Once charged, I used them very successfully for the first time last nite.  The sound quality is good, with a very light hiss of background noise. The background noise is not annoying and is way down in level, but is good since it tells you that you the headphones are on and it's the TV program that might be silent for the momentThe comfort is nice, but if you're sitting in bed with your head against a pillow, then you may find that the pillow sort of pushes the headphone cups away from  your ears. So it takes a bit of pillow punching to get everything squared away, but this unit perfectly accomplished my mission, which is: to watch TV at night without waking the spouse up.Charging seems pretty automatic - just place the headset on the chargers hanging rack, and the red light indicates charging is going on. You don't have to be accurate about positioning.Highly recommended. I did not give the full 5 stars just because at times I felt I heard some distortion in actors voices now and then... like a sample error of some sort... it was minor but noticeable.

These devices never seem to have the advertised range.  Today, for example, I took them to the opposite end of the house, upstairs, and tucked into a corner bathroom which goes through numerous walls and is quite far from the transmitter.  Not the slightest bit of noise - the sound (music in this case) was incredible.  This unit accomplishes everything it advertises!

I've used for over a month almost every evening with never an interruption for the batteries.  The RS120 Charger Cradle plugs into our Mitsubishi TV's stereo Audio Output RCA jacks & 115Vac wall Receptacle.  I like the Red light indicator on the Charger Cradle that indicates when the earphones are positioned on the cradle and charging as well as the Green light indicator that indicates that the audio signal is present and then automatically shuts off when the TV is turned off after a short time.  I have left the unit on the default channel but have changed the tuning to see if I can return to the crystal clarity and had no problem doing so.  Being able to leave the TV area and venture to the other end of the house, garage, and even the back porch/yard and still hear the TV audio is crazy.The RS120 has made TV much more enjoyable for me and probably for my bride now with the room audio volume turned down considerably.

PS, if you're buying a tv these days, be careful to check the back before buying. Most decent size LCDs/plasma's don't have headphone jacks, many do not have RCA audio outputs, and some cheap models don't even have optical outputs. I'm not sure how optical to RCA converters worked, so, I wanted one with RCA audio out in addition to optical, and second choice would be headphone jack. In my humble opinion, RCA-output is the best because there is constant output level and you then control the TV speakers with the mute button on your remote. If you are limited to a headphone jack, the speakers usually are cut out when the phones are plugged in making it necessary to be plugging and unplugging whenever you use the phones and then want to go back to the speakers. Back to the 120's. First of all - sound quality is excellent, tho I don't use them primarily for music, I'd have no hesitation to do so. Unlike the 170 and 180's they don't have features like base boost nor do they have the surround sound simulation that the 170/180's have. PS: this feature on the 170's is really cool and I love using them on my family room tv for action movies. But, back to the 120's: even without these features, the sound is great. Next, reception: unbelievable. I've been all over my house to test them and they work great, even on different floors. Next: comfort. I actually really like the "on the ear" fit for my purposes. Soft pads, no irritation, but haven't yet worn for hours. I can say that, since I have both, there is one advantage of these compared with "over the ear" fit that is a feature of the 170's. With over the ear, if your head is resting on a cushion/pillow such that the cushion/pillow pushes on the earpiece, it causes the earpiece to put pressure on the back of your ear and actually can cause irritation. It's my one complaint (albeit minor) about my 170's. The one problem wiht the "on ear" fit of the 120's is that it is not "secure" - i.e, because they fit lightly and comfortably, if you want to wear them while you're say doing a project that requires bending over, they'll tend to slip off your head/ears. If you're sitting, at your computer, lying down for a nap, no problem. But if you''re going to be active with them - like working in the garage or cleaning the house while wearing them, might consider the more secure fit of over the ear. Since they're not over the ear, they're not as noise isolating, but that can be an advantage if you want to know what's going on around you - like hearing your wife calling you or the doorbell, etc. Finally, as for some of the criticisms of others that I've seen posted on these reviews, here's my take:1. Hiss: non existent. none. I'm using these with RCA outputs on my tv that have constant output and in this mode 0 hiss at any volume even with total silence on the source. If you're using headphone jack output, probably should have the component volume up enough (normal listening level) so you don't have to crank the phones - but I've pushed the volume on these during silence on screen without any hiss!!2. Unable to charge with earpieces extended. Huh? Maybe they've changed the design of base unit, but this is simply NOT true. I've extended them all the way and set on the base to charge. No problemo.3. Volume control on same side as tuning wheel. Please.4. Auto on/off. So far no problem while watching TV.  I suppose if you're pausing dvd's frequently, this could be a minor annoyance, but if you're wearing wireless headphones the need to pause should be minimal, since you can keep listening while you grab a beer in the kitchen or take care of business in the bathroom! Here's the bottom line on this: I TURNED THE TV OFF AND CLOCKED THE TIME-TO-AUTO-SHUTOFF: 3 minutes exactly. So.. how can this be a problem listening to music: suggest if this a problem you are using a headphone jack and the component volume is set incredibly low, turn it up a bit! Oh, yeah, when the base is off, then turn the tv on, the time between tv volume "on" and base unit auto on is virtually instantaneous.  Again if, not getting this performance, suspect it is headphone jack and component volume problem.Overall: this is a great set of wireless headphones at a reasonable price (less than $100 on amazon) and the problems noted by others have either been engineered out of the product over the years (some of the negative reviews are years old), or the folks with problems haven't set them up correctly (using headphone jack with component volume turned too low). For best results, try the rca audio outputs and if you're going to buy a new tv, look for and get a tv that has this feature!.

I have killed more than one set of headphones by them getting flung from my head to the ground or tearing off the connector.  I had been considering wireless headphones for a year or more before finally making this purchase.One of the aspects of wireless headphones that I wanted to avoid was the need to replace batteries every week or so.  I am not good about keeping batteries handy, and would probably end up not using the headphone much because they would be out of juice.  The handy charging stand fixed this issue.I have also been afraid of the dreading "hiss" of wireless headphones.  While no audiophile, I am not a fan of white noise messing with my music.  I am happy to say that has not been an issue.  Every once in while, if I turn my head one exact way I get some static, but it is very minor.  Overall these headphones sound better and are more comfortable then the wired Sony MDR-NC6 headphones they are replacing.  The Sony headphones have noise canceling that works great, but for office use that is a bad thing.  You don't want to be too isolated at work.

For all of these qualities the headphones delivered without disappointment! With Dad's impaired vision and some slight dementia, he is still able to get the headphones on and off without incident, and the way the charging is accomplished through the wire hoop that acts as a stand/holder for the headphones was pure genius on the part of Sennheiser!The range is good enough that he can not only listen anywhere in his room, but even as he roams the halls and the dining room! There are controls right on each headphone earpad , one for on/off and the other for volume control, which Dad has a little trouble with, but I am sure were designed to be discrete for the average user. It took a little training to get Dad to be able to find and use those switches.Dad gets daily use out of these headphones and they have brought much enjoyment to his life.Our only concerns were about accommodating his needs. The switches on the headphones are a little difficult for older, stiffer fingers, and the two LEDs on the Base unit are too small for him to see easily.

This comes in handy while our family wishes to spend time in "together" but doing other things that the television will interfere with, like reading or using the computer.  Sadly, we can not purchase additional headphones for the unit because we've found ourselves arguing over who gets to use them now, because the sound is SO clear you get to hear EVERY step, breath and all the background discussions that, as middle-agers, we now miss with normal hearing.  The only true downside were the lack of instructions.  We would like to use them with our small video player while it is connected to the television, but that won't work for some reason.  Luckily, our son hasn't left for college yet and was able to figure out that we have to hook up the unit to the sattelite box if we want to hear television, but we're still trying to figure out how to listen to movies played on a VCR or DVD player.

I was playing xbox 360, and took me around 5 minutes to finally get a good enough sound. Forget about amazing stereo sound, it really sounds like an analogic radio at best. And then, I decided to change seats from the couch to the chair, a loud interference noise almost gave me a heart attack.Don't waste your money on this, save a little bit more and get a descent headphone. I regret buying this, hopefully  amazon has an amazing customer support and post sales, and I'm sure I'll be able to get my money back..

After having these in the box for a couple of weeks and several unsuccessful attempts at installation a friend finally helped me out. He did manage to get them working. Keep in mind I have never used wireless ear phones before just top quality ear bubs. I use these in my 38' 5th wheel trailer. The flat screen HD TV is mounted on an adjustable base in a cabinet. It's hooked up to a Harmon Kardon surround system. The base for the ear phones is in the cabinet behind the TV which doesn't seen to interfere with it's reception.Here is my short review.THE PRO'S:  I have NO hiss whatsoever. The sound is clear. The mids and high range are very good. The charging unit is very easy to use and seems to be doing a great job. They are comfortable to wear and don't make my ears hot. My wife can sleep with no TV noise coming from the living room. (BIG BONUS).THE CON'S: You do pick up back ground noise such as the portable heater fan working in the background. They fit loose and tend to come off easy. The piece of foam that sits on top of your head could be thicker and more comfortable. I don't find them all that light weight but I wouldn't consider them heavy either. In my opinion the base sound is week and could be stronger.MY QUESTION:The phones work fine except when I switch the TV to surround sound. Then the signal gets jumbled, the sound then becomes fractured. For a couple of seconds it's fantastic but then breaks up. If I take it off surround the phones are very clear but lack the depth of the surround sound. If these worked with my surround sound I would be over the moon.

However, as others have said, the base station shuts off if it doesn't detect audio. Well, if that were all it was, I would deal with it. However, when the base shuts off EVEN WHEN THERE IS audio, thus producing the ear drum shattering static, it becomes unacceptable! I use my wireless headphones on my computer to watch DVDs and online movies in bed and the base station will "go out" in the middle of a conversation; so I know there is audio. In order to get the base station to come on again, I have to get up, shut the headphones off, place them back on the cradle wait a couple of minutes, pick them up, turn them back on and MAYBE they will again be working. Unfortunately for me, I already threw the box away so I won't be returning them. However, I won't be wasting my money of Sennheiser products again and because I paid less than [...] for them, perhaps I got off lucky.The range is likewise less than optimal. I live in a 2-bedroom apartment (approx 1,000 sq ft). Static is heard while even in the same room as the base and if I walk into the kitchen from the bedroom... forget it; the static is so bad it becomes too difficult to understand the conversations taking place on the DVD I am attempting to listen to.I've never encountered the problem some have mentioned concerning the discomfort on the ear pads as I have not been able to keep them on my head long enough to see if the pads become uncomfortable.But other than that, these headphones are fine. If you need a paperweight or want to decorate a room, then these are perfect. However, if you want to listen to music or movies, perhaps you should look elsewhere..

So I really like them.This is a great, inexpensive little compact AM-FM with excellent reception and good battery life (specs say 40 hours and I probably get about that with rechargeables). Has a 3.5mm standard earbuds jack. It's just barely shirt pocket sized (YMMV) but easily fits in a hiking day pack, shoulder bag,  pants cargo pocket, car console etc. It has AMAZING reception for both its size and low price, and SURPRISINGLY good sound quality, especially for a low price. Very sturdy retracting antenna. Wrist lanyard. I get around 40 hours use per set of rechargeable batteries, which is exactly the battery life that Sony claims. If you're not familiar with compact radios, that's VERY good battery life. Music is quite decent...not Bose, but fine for backyard, poolside, camping etc.Wish it had digital channel display, but you can't have everything and the analog type dial display is workable if not pinpoint-accurate. I like the retro transistor-radio styling. Toss one in the car, one in your beach bag, one or more for your home-emergency-power-outage kit/s. I've used mine a good deal, no complaints. Simple useful design, minimum moving parts, it's a winner. There are a lot of basic radios out there with higher price and much less quality, so don't over-think it, just get this one, you'll be glad.For emergencies (power outages, storms, hurricanes etc) I suggest getting a couple of these to stay in touch with news, etc.These don't come with any kind of case...if you want some protection in a backpack, etc, I'd grab one of those little neoprene cases from the dollar stores.

It certainly doesn't help that I bought this radio solely for listening to with headphones as most of the issues are related to that.  The loudspeaker is acceptable, though much poorer quality than my $20 alarm clock radio.Pros:-I've used it at work for an average of probably 4 hours/day and it's still on the first set of batteries after over a month and a half.-Good AM reception.Cons:-The left channel only headphone thing is really quite annoying. I got a mono to stereo adapter for it but it makes the radio a full inch wider and more awkward and it doesn't have the best connection so if I move the headphone wire too much, the radio will start playing out loud in my otherwise silent office building. Not okay. This could have been fixed at the factory for a fraction of a penny added cost. All it takes is a different headphone connector and an additional glob of solder.-The volume knob is absolutely unusable. I shouldn't have to hold the radio with both hands and as carefully as possible nudge the volume knob up to begin hearing anything, only to have my ear drums burst when the sound finally does show up.  And the first half turn of the dial is complete dead space, and the max volume is waaayyy beyond the distortion level. Awful.Buying a set of Sony headphones with inline volume control set to minimum makes it more bearable, but still a terrible design. Not to mention they cost 150% of the price of this entire radio. They, however, are worth it.-I've read about people saying this radio is great because it has an external antenna and doesn't use the headphone cord for reception. Great, but not true.  I've found manipulating my antenna does next to nothing whatsoever, whereas moving the cord can be the difference between perfect reception and getting a completely different station in epic fuzz. I've also found the radio completely unusable without a 3' extension for this purpose. This wasn't always the case, and I've noticed my reception getting worse and worse day by day. Needs batteries, right? Well, a brand new set of batteries made no difference, so I'm beginning to conclude the radio is just dying before it even uses the first set of batteries fully.-You might think, oh, well this guy just is in a dead zone for radio and is trying to get long distance stations.  Well, that's not the case. I'm in a highly populated city listening to local stations. My big comparison is that the radio feature on my 5 year old Sony Ericsson phone gets the same station in the same spot perfectly clear without a headphone extension when this radio requires precise placement of the almost 6 feet of combined headphone cable with extension. Antenna fully up and extended is no different than folded away.2 stars for the battery life and AM reception. I would say it might be worth the money if you bought it for use without headphones, but unless you listen to talk radio only, I wouldn't be able to deal with the sound quality for an extended period. A deal at ten bucks? Hardly..

Around 45 miles southeast of Chicago it pulls in stations all across the AM and FM bands, doing a very good job of separating one station from another.

Details of this nice listening device...Frequency range is 87.5-108 MHz in FM; 530-1605 kHz in AM. This is standard, and stations come in pretty clear. The antenna is for FM; it extends to about 18" long and folds into the left side of the radio. The antenna folds out, but it doesn't swivel around. I've found that reception is really good, and the antenna is necessary only in the basement. For AM, a ferrite bar antenna is built-in. Tuning is done with a dial scale; not digital. Fine-tuning with the dial is easy. A slide on the right side adjusts between AM and FM.The radio has two speakers built in; one on the front and one on the back. They're 2-1/4" diameter each. Sound is nice and clear. You can use headphones, as a jack is provided on the left side. However, this radio uses monoaural for headphone use; you'll only hear sound from the "right" ear. I fixed this by buying an adapter from Radio Shack. Specifically, you're looking for a 1/8" (3.5mm) Mono Male to 1/8" (3.5mm) Stereo Female Adapter. They cost three dollars. This adapter isn't necessary for speaker use; only for headphones.The radio runs on two AA batteries. Listed runtime is 40 hours on FM and 45 hours on AM. This is with intermittent use, as running the radio until the batteries die will significantly shorten runtime. For me, intermittent runtime was 42 hours on Duracell, 41 hours on Rayovac, and 37 hours on Energizer (FM). Runtime was 47 hours on Duracell, 46 hours on Rayovac, and 42 hours on Energizer (AM). Those runtimes are on standard alkalines; rechargeables will be a little less, while lithiums will be a lot more. Running the radio without turning it off will decrease those runtimes by half.Size is 2-7/8" wide X 4-3/4" high X 1-3/16" deep (71mm X 118.5mm X 30mm). The radio weighs 7 ounces (202 g) with alkalines installed. Power output is 100mW at 10% harmonic distortion.The tune indicator lights up in red, and serves as a low battery indicator when it dims. A wrist strap is attached to the left side, and is large enough for most users. I'm guessing it's about 10" long. The strap is made of shoestring-type cord; it's round, not flat. It's also pretty sturdy. I haven't tested my radio for drops or water resistance, but it feels like it would be operable as long as you don't throw it. The battery compartment is clearly marked for polarity and uses clean, quality springs. There's not a pull tab to remove the batteries, but it's not necessary. The battery compartment closes with a non-captive slide-on piece of plastic. It retains well, and shaking mine didn't pop it off.In short, this is a great radio. The sound is excellent (considering the size) and it works every time I turn it on. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I had to buy an adapter for headphone use. This isn't just a defective unit; I have three more of these and they're all the same. Some users here have mentioned it on theirs as well. But, it's a $3 fix. Give this radio a try; you could do a lot worse for ten bucks..

I have to say they were absolutely correct! The packaging and feel of this radio are "cheap" meaning it is very light. While I cannot determine it's durability, it works great.It dialed in both FM/AM very well in my mid-sized suburban city. The one thing to note is how great the speaker is. Listening to music or talk radio programs were a joy on this little device. I don't remember a time when I got a cheap radio like this and liked listening through the speaker verses earphones.The only down side, like others have mentioned is that there is only mono on one earphone. If they could correct this while keeping the speaker quality it would be excellent.I also ordered the grey Kaito KA200 Pocket AM/FM Radio also offered here on Amazon.com and found that while it was much smaller and worked ok (great choice for travel, pocket sized), I would prefer to use the Sony. While it is a little bigger I think it's worth it. The antenna is better on the Sony than the Kaito, but can't really faut either due to the size difference..

Acceptable AM reception and very nice FM reception.Biggest complaint is the volume control.  As others have noted, you click the radio on and the first 5% of the volume control travel does nothing.  The next 5% of travel gets you to 50% of the volume VERY fast, and 50% is pretty loud.  The remainder of the volume control travel takes you from pretty loud to screaming loud.As a result, it's tricky to set a comfortable volume level if you're trying to not disturb someone 10' away.  It's doable, but it takes two hands and very gentle nudging of the volume control.For our intended use (essentially an emergency set-aside), it's workable and not worth doing the return process, even though Amazon has free return postage for things that don't work correctly.

How good can it be at the price-point?  I've been using it for 30 days now and here some thoughts that might help you if you're asking yourself the same question.Let's start with design: it's solid.  The cabinet has heft to it and is not flimsy in any way.  Keep in mind it's big though.  If you're looking for something small and invisible this is not it.  While it's not huge, it's certainly cannot be called small.  I have it near a plant in a corner in my living room so I never see it, but it is big - be sure to take a look at the dimensions.Buzz, static etc: I have not run across any humming or static when the sub is not in use.  I used mediabridge's sub cables and highly recommend them.  The cable is inexpensive but well made.  I wonder if other reviewers who reported hum, etc, may have just been using bad cables.Sound Quality: I'll break this down into movies and music.  It performs well for both, but I do think it's more oriented towards movies and &#34;boom&#34; rather than fast-punch mid-bass like smaller subs.  It's a 10&#34; sub, so don't expect it to perform like an 8&#34; when listening to music.  That said though, I never feel like I made a bad choice when listening to music with it.  On rare occasions I wish it was &#34;punchier&#34;, but for 99% of the time, I think the sub just sounds great.Bottom line: it's the best sub you'll find for the money..

The manual is far from clear about this, and plenty of people will probably spend extra on a Y cable, or worse yet, put in an adapter which will add both cost and loss of fidelity.  But just connecting to the left input works fine.  Subwoofers are mono anyway, and the double inputs are primarily there to make certain wiring configurations easier, not to add more sound fidelity..

Only after setting up my receiver/performing the calibration with the sub and running some excellent material (BlackHawk Down, Ironman, Startrek) on bluray did the power of the active sub come into play.Everyone who thinks that Power rating is important for bass will know after having "listened" to a good active sub. In this case if you really want to feel bass the criteria should be: how low do you want to go!! Size then does matter. At least a 10 inch sub would give that "feel" of LFE "sound". De power rating would then be dependant on the size of the room. A 50-100 Watt is sufficient for a "normal" living room.Of course there is a small gripe. I still have a low hum when connecting power to my PS3. Will work on sorting this out..

After some research, we decided on the Polk. Best decision ever. This thing is super! Hook up was beyond easy.Some people seem to be complaining about it not being great, some claim it sounds "muddy", etc. However, we haven't experienced these things and as long as you have your settings correct, it's fantastic for movies, music & games. Those complaining about the boominess or "muddy" sound likely do not have their equipment adjusted for the sub right or the knobs set properly on the sub for the room they have it set up in. We have a receiver with a single "sub out" jack and the Low-Pass knob on the back of the subwoofer all the way clockwise which creates an LFE input (since this sub doesn't have one). After a couple days of testing, we found that the best place for the sub's volume knob was just below half. With that, we've got GREAT bass all around for practically every situation whether we're watching movies, playing games or even listening to music (which seems to be the primary gripe out there for this sub...don't listen to 'em) and it doesn't make the rest of the range sound murky. Dialog is crystal clear & higher frequencies are distinct. Just set it up according to the manual & then make minor adjustments until you find what works best for the room and you.One point of note that likely won't affect many people...We have a PS3 hooked up to the tv via HDMI  and the tv is outputting sound to our receiver with an optical cable. Games sound AWESOME on it with two exceptions...Rock Band & especially Guitar Hero. The output on those isn't tailor made for output in this fashion evidently & we find we have much fuller sound on those with a standard PlayStation output cable with the left & right audio RCA plugs going directly to the receiver. It sounds counter to everything one might have heard or understands about sound with this equipment, but it works great for those two game series. We just have the PS3 set up to output audio to multiple sources & whenever we want to play Rock Band or Guitar Hero games, switch the receiver over to that input and voila...fantastic, full, rich sound with plenty of bass while not drowning out the higher frequencies.All in all, this is a wonderful subwoofer, easily the best one I've had experience with in this price range. It won't break the bank and you'll LOVE it once you have it set up properly for your living room/den/entertainment room.HIGHLY recommended!!.

Highly recommended. This baby packs quite a wallop at high or low volumes. With a trained ear and some tweaking, anyone can appreciate this near set it and forget it subwoofer.However, for the single subwoofer coaxial output on your receiver, you're going to need an RCA single female input to double male Left/Right channel output connector in order to connect this unit properly. I think they (POLK) should include this with the product.If you own at least a midrange receiver of a clean 110 watt output or more, this solidly built Polk Powered subwoofer can take some serious punishment and is a perfect addition to any system.I push a shared 300 watts through this subwoofer with a Yamaha natural sound receiver. Along with a main pair of Cerwin Vega CLS-12's, a pair of Cerwin Vega bookshelf speakers and center channel as they all combine harmoniously in the joy of blissful home theater Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The additional subwoofer completes the audiophile pile thus making the living room walls, picture frames and furniture vibrate and shake while watching a good Blueray movie.Bottom line: Rock Solid, tight and precise lows and low/mids and it really seems to hold it's own in the end. Well worth the research, reviews and purchase. I've had it about a month now and I like surprising guests when a big boom happens in a movie. It makes us all jump and go wide eyed when it's first felt, then heard!  >;-].

I have not turned the volume on the sub past 50%.  It seems to fill out the lower end of normal sounds o.k., and does a better job at the rumble and punch for movie sound effects.  It is OK for music with heavy bass, but not perfect.  I have room for another sub and will probably upgrade for the next one.  If I buy two new ones I will move this to my old surround system.

It's being used in a 20'x16' guestroom with an Onkyo receiver, Sony SSB-3000s, & an old 27" Sony XBR. Originally, I expected to spend around $100 for an 8"...or even a 6.5...to add a little more "fullness" to the sound. So when I saw this sub for $69, my figuring was that I couldn't go wrong! And...so far...not a single regret!! I've got it hooked to the "B" speaker outputs, enabling it to be used either to greatly enhance music, or as a subtle solo support for the TV(too big of stereo sound for such a small screen is overkill!). It took some tweaking of all the components combined to find the desired sound, along with the right balance for simply switching between the two, but it's worth the effort. I really don't want guests to have to hassle with things like that.Now, I'm not saying this sub doesn't have it's limitations, 'cause if you plan on using it as your only low end source in something like a 1000 sq. foot room...this ain't the sub for you. But in a 'normal size' room, you'll probably find this Polk to be much more than adequate. Watching Jurassic Park, it does surprisingly well in reproducing those frequencies you can 'feel' but may not necessarily be able to 'hear' - if you know what I mean. And it can do this even at fairly low levels.When all is said & done, one could easily spend $500 or more for another sub.

But for some reason it didn't.I see more reliability with this one,faster speeds,BETTER RECEPTION no dropped signal at all because it has 2.4GHz ONLY .No 5GHz frequency means no interference with neighbor's home phone. Also 2.4GHz can penetrate the walls BETTER than 5GHz because lower frequency waves are "longer"(can go through objects without losing the power).And of course I'm planning to install tomato on this :) (if you know what I'm talking about ;)P.S.The price actually WENT UP about 10% since January 2011 but still a good choice I think.Do not leave this router on carpet because it was air ventilation holes on bottom and top.The dust can go inside and cause some hardware problems later.*********ADDED**********I've been using this router for about 1 year and 3 months now and it's still excellent.No difference at all,works like a brand new beast.BONUS: If you have this product and if you're somewhat tech-savvy person then I HIGHLY recommend installing Tomato Firmware because the original firmware comes with a feature called WPS which is known to be vulnerable to brute-force attacks so your Wi-Fi password can be cracked within 12 hours(no matter how complex your password is!).When you install Tomato Firmware,it wipes out the tiny operating system inside the router and installs a superior one, which doesn't have any vulnerabilities.ATTENTION: Changing the firmware will VOID YOUR WARRANTY..

However, once I shipped it, they were very prompt in shipping me a "reman" unit (another term for remanufactured/refurbished or second-hand). I wasn't thrilled about receiving a second-hand router, but it has functioned well till now, and it has been close to 10 days since I started using it. Hopefully it will stay that way. I've increased my rating to 3-stars after the prompt customer service and return.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought the router in August 2011. I have used a similar router before, so setting up was not a big issue. The wireless capability was decent, and it worked okay for a couple of months. I would need to restart it every now and then, as either the speed would get too slow, or my computer (Mac) won't connect wirelessly to it. I wasn't exactly crazy about the product, but it was okay. Until it stopped working absolutely, one fine day in December 2011.The power LED keeps blinking, and all the other LEDs are just lit constantly. I went online and searched for solutions, including a couple of different methods of hard resetting (30/30/30 sec or the 10/turnoff/10/turnon/10 sec). This didn't fix the problem. I tried pinging the default address (192.168.1.1) of the router through my computer via LAN cable, after setting my computer at a static address, which is in the same subnet as the router (e.g., 192.168.1.10 and setting the router/default gateway as 192.168.1.1). It was unreachable. According to certain forums, this is equivalent to 'bricking' your router, if you were trying to install some other 3rd party firmware on it, and failed. I hadn't done anything like that.I finally got around talking to a Cisco rep online. They've decided this is a defective model. They've asked me to initiate a return request through the Cisco RMA department. I am going to ship out this model and wait for the new one and see how that works.A friend has used this model for years without issue, and I was expecting the same. I wasn't totally satisfied with its performance even when it was working, though maybe that was just because of it being defective. I will update this review after I receive the new piece..

I have the WRT54G v2, which is the same of the WRT54GL. It's a valid point I guess.- Stability:What I must add to the crowd of 5-star rating is that it is dependable and is rock solid. It just goes running 24/7, and keeps going with no stability issues, no lock-ups, nothing. And most important (and common with other routers): no wireless drop outs. I once ran it for 2 or 3 months I guess, only to be stopped by an energy blackout.Mine is 5 years old (and a few months), and I still use it for routing my home network. I have 3 computers, 1 media player, 1 media server and 1 wireless extender, all together sharing a broadband connection. It handles the load just fine, streaming high bitrate content on wired is perfect. True, the router is very outdated by today's standards (think wifi range and speed), but the fact that I still use it --- if only for routing and handling load --- tells how dependable the box is. You "set and forget", no checking, no rebooting, nothing. The fame is due.I bought other routers, and some with the same or similar platform (Buffalo WHR-HP-G54), but they were not as stable as this one. No wonder those always find a way being just an AP, while the WRT keeps routing and doing the hard work.- Features:Granted, I have a 3rd party firmware on it (have used OpenWrt and DD-WRT, now on Tomato), but that's what is good about it. QoS, "access restriction" (on/off schedule for wifi), dynamic DNS, time server or any other custom task (if you have the Linux skills) you can imagine. People run everything on them. What I do here is just the "surface" of what can be "scratched".- Cons:The outdated specs. No N, of course, range and speed seems to be on the bad side.- Support:Years ago, when I didn't know about 3rd party firmwares (that was 2005), I was having a problem with dropped Internet connection. The Linksys support on the web was quick and solved the problem (config). Mind you, after that I never used the support again, so I don't know if Linksys support is still good (or if it ever was and I was just lucky). Not knowing is, of course, a good thing in this case, and speaks favorably for the router.- Final thoughts:That's about it. Buying many things that promise more and deliver less, I'm rarely enthusiastic with electronics, but this one is a winner. Also, not trying other firmwares on this does not do it justice. Installing a 3rd party firmware is also much easier than it used to be, so anyone with reasonable knowledge and the ability to read instructions exactly as written can do it. I didn't search much lately, so I don't think if we have a comparable, proven and trusted 11n kit like the WRT was with 11g.I give it 5 stars, period. No footnotes, no asterisks, no nonsense..

While shopping for a new wireless router I looked at a lot of N-band routers but they either didn't have external antennas (for when I buy a house) or they were some off brand that I couldn't trust.  Then, I decided that I didn't really need 100+ Mbps - my internet connection speed never tops 15 Mbps, so 54 Mbps is enough for my laptop, my Roku and my Xbox no problem.  I don't use wireless to do many network transfers (laptop &lt;-> desktop) and even when I do, the limiting factor was never wireless speed, but hard drive r/w speeds, so I decided I'd buy the industry standard in wireless routers - the WRT54GL.  This is, and has been, a rock solid piece of equipment - just look at NewEgg.com - it has thousands of reviews praising it for performance, longevity, expandability, etc...My only disappointment with this router, was that after I had it set up so that the Xbox didn't have any NAT issues with Xbox Live and after I had the Roku connecting and streaming to it, it deleted all my setup.  It happened the same day the cable company remote reset our cable modem - the router returned to factory default settings.  That was a pain - especially to get the Roku working again.Still, this router has been stable, performing like a workhorse since I bought it and the dozens of people I've recommended buy this (literally, dozens) that have, have enjoyed a stable, simple wireless setup.

It's at least twice as fast as my cable modem can put out data, so that's &#34;fast enough&#34; for me.I had to set it up manually because the setup &#34;wizard&#34; program couldn't detect the router after all of the seven steps to plug it an the cable modem in though Windows said it was connected to the internet through the router and cable modem.

Also, when in the portrait mode, there is no way to plug in the 30-pin adapter for the Apple product. I have noticed one can turn the device upside down for many applications, but this if foreign.

The rubberized parts are well located to prevent the stand, or your tablet, from slipping. I especially appreciate the ability to adjust, even fine-tune the angle. And that it folds up so it can be transported easily is really nice. However, unfolding, and then having to readjust, could become annoying if one needed to do so frequently. Also, it does seem that if you're going to be adjusting it frequently, the ratchets might wear out (a concern also expressed by others). For my purposes though--keeping it pretty much in place with the same adjustment most of the time for home use, with the possibility that I might occasionally travel and pack it in a large handbag or suitcase, it's fine.But to be honest, I'm even more happy with my COMOS mini portable stand (purchased as an Add-on item here on Amazon).

The pod is great for casual shooting when I need more stability than I can provide by hand. I use it to shoot long exposures at night and with the panorama feature on the camera.It isn't as easy to wrap the thing around railings and fences and tree limbs and such as I thought it would be, mostly because I didn't understand how short the legs are, but once it's in place it stays put. It's better for the night shots than the panorama because keeping the camera level while panning it isn't really easy, particularly when the tripod is wrapped around something at an odd angle, but it's still easier than hand held.I've had the Gorillapod for about a month now. I read some complaints about the construction quality before I bought it, but I haven't seen any indications of weakness with the amount of stress I put on the joints. It grips smooth surfaces such as metal handrails pretty well and I'm comfortable wrapping it around tree limbs at the aforementioned odd angles without worrying that it'll take a dive.I would be okay with putting something maybe up to a pound on the pod but I would worry about the stability of it with a long lens. This isn't a substitute for a heavier traditional pod if you need to keep the camera absolutely level or if you're shooting with a DSLR or other interchangeable lens camera. Common sense would dictate that you don't rely on a $15 tripod to keep a thousand bucks worth of camera and lens intact.For what it is, it's great..

I can sit this tripod on my desk or wrap it around something else to suspend the camera in up in the air and shoot downward.  The flexible legs give me a world of opportunities for getting different angles on pictures.  I can make minor height or angle adjustment just by bending one or more of the legs a bit.Also, even outside I can wrap the legs around my hand and it helps me steady the camera for certain pictures.The downside with my particular camera is that the structure is not stiff enough.  Between the weight of the camera and the pressure needed to trip the shutter, I end up moving the camera even when I have it locked down on the tripod on my desk, so I need one hand to steady the camera even with the tripod.

This fact makes this tripod unusable for long exposures (which is what I use tripods for). If you're using the tripod to take pictures of yourself and your sweetie with the camera hanging in a tree (instead of holding the camera at arm's length) then you're in luck.I have a small Manfrotto tripod that doesn't flex when pressing the shutter, so I guess I'll keep using that.Having said this, the Gorillapod is still pretty cool.

Don't let it's short stature of only a foot tall fool you, the idea with this tripod is not to just stand it up like a normal tripod (it can do that too), it's to be able to attach it to pretty much anything. It's also highly portable and light in weight.Those ball-legs with colored rings are actually ball joints with rubber rings. They are very bendable and stiff (DO NOT LUBE THEM! They are supposed to be stiff). If the legs can wrap around something tightly, you can hang the camera there and it will stay there. Because of that, it can sit or stand in places that a normal tripod cannot be. About the only thing that it'll have trouble with is wide open areas with nothing to sit it on since it's very short and couldn't film something, say eye-level, on it's own. But how often is there absolutely nothing around you?The only catch with this thing is that you MUST buy the one you need for your camera/ camcorder. Why? Well, they can only support so much weight before they start to sag downwards and give under the weight. But, if you buy the one you need for the camera's weight, you can hang your camcorder with no sagging at all, even sideways where the camera has weight leverage or upside down.

There are larger models that handle larger and heavier camera equipment.The second thing is this tri-pod is good in limited situations. It really is small and you can't really set it on the ground to capture a shot, unless you want your picture to look like it was taken by a mouse. You also can't expect to find things in nature to wrap it around and some things like vertical tree trunks, poles, etc., are just asking for the tri-pod to slip off and explode your camera.That said, in some situations it works out perfectly. Tables, chairs, fences, large rocks, your car, railings, and other fairly stable platforms or thin vertical platforms are perfect to wrap this thing around and stabilize for a timed shot without asking random strangers to snap a shot. My own experience with asking people is 1 in 3 of a decent shot with most shots being blurred, head/feet cut off, bad framing, people in the background, missing the background I wanted, etc.I like this little guy.

The main attraction of this surge protector was a high level of power protection (3996 joules) combined with complete data-line protection (coax/RJ11/RJ45 (Ethernet)) at a very competitive price. Belkin claims that this unit meets the recommended UL 1449 (power surge protection), UL 1363 (power cord) and UL 1283 (EMI/RFI filter) standards, but they do not mention meeting the UL 497 standard (surge protection for telephone lines (RJ11) and network lines (RJ45)). You may want to consider the Tripp-Lite TLP810NET at a higher price if full certification to UL standards is important to you.The Belkin surge suppressor is well designed and easy to use. Belkin provides a $300,000 warranty to replace equipment that was damaged by an electrical surge when that equipment was properly connected to their surge protector.After receiving the five units, I did a quality check for each one by connecting it to a computer with telephone (RJ11) and network connections (RJ45). I did not check the coax connection and, obviously, I did not check the surge suppression capability of these units. I was particularly concerned about any degradation of network speed when connected through the surge protector, so I performed a broadband test of upload/download speed using [...] after making the network connection. I found that 4 of 5 surge protectors passed my quality check, but 1 of the 5 surge protectors had a defective RJ45 connection and was returned for replacement. I also found that the broadband speed was not affected when connected through the network connection (RJ45) of the 4 surge protectors that passed my quality check.Once you get passed the hassle of possibly receiving a defective unit, the Belkin surge suppressor appears to be a good value..

This is a no brainer. You absolutely need a surge protector to shield your electronic goodies from harm. Surges can be caused by your electrical utility provider, lightning, or a car crashing into a local transformer. This will handle class 3 surges, and meets industrial grade requirements. So, not to worry. Its 4,156 joules more than meets minimum requirements.Here is Belkin's blurb on this Belkin model:"* 12-outlet surge protector with 10-foot cord ideal for high-end home and professional workstations 4156 Joules* Ideal solution for computers, laser printers, and home-theater systems;* Outlets include sliding safety covers; detachable cord-management clip for cable organization* Right-angle plug keeps cord close to the wall* Belkin Lifetime Warranty and $300,000 Connected Equipment Warranty."Having 12 outlets handles all my stereo and TV components, a lamp, and WiFi connections with two left over. At my desk it connects my WiFi, cell phone charger, lamp, laptop and charger, printer, router, cell phone signal booster, and internet modum with three left over for new neighbors in future. The 12-outlet design works perfectly for me. If you plug in a large wall wart or a large adapters you will want those extra plug-ins because they take up two outlets....as you well know. As it is, the three outlets on either side of the six closely spaced center outlets will provide space for small to medium sized wall warts or adapters.It appears to be made well: the housing is robust, the power cord is heavy duty, and the outlets have not failed me yet, not one. Having "Phone/Ethernet/Coaxial Protection" is very important to me. The reviews here average 4.6 stars, and that is reassuring to me. Without the trolls, sock puppets, and ankle biters it would probably rate 4.8. The warranty is fantastic too, if they actually make good on it.I hope this was helpful to you.

I'd just filled the last plug on my old CyberPower 8-plug surge protector and decided to be ready for whenever I added the next component to my HT.  I'd also recently picked up a ground loop hum in a new subwoofer that was not present in my old one, so I wanted something with coax pass through to try and eliminate that issue.  This unit has been great on both accounts.  While basic, it's well built and all 12 plugs are extremely well spaced.  6 of the outlets (3 on each side) point out with wide spacing for wall-wart style DC transformers, while 6 outlets down the middle are spaced for standard AC plugs.  This eliminates wall-warts covering outlets and rendering them useless.

Great design, all the pivot connectors are usable, I way that because  I've had previous surge protectors which was flat in design, and once a lengthy adapter is plugged in sideways, it would block the space of 2 others! This you can rotate the adapter out of the way of other plugs and therefore can use all the outlets, which is a great plus,and the reason why i bought this one, compared to less expensive but similar products out there!Another design feature I liked is that the back of the protector is not curved it is flat, which was important for me, because I used a Velcro stripVelcro Extreme Indoor/Outdoor Rough Surface Fasteners, 1 inch x 4 inches, 10 per pack (90812)to attach this to the back of the table, and they stick better and stays on the Velcro longer if the surface is flat rather than curved!I have had good things to say about Belkin always and this one is also nothing different, great product and great innovative design! Although the cable management hooks are not great, but nothing a few twisty ties can't fix!My only disconnect was that this was pricey compared to the other similar (Same joules, no. of outlets, features etc) products out there! So value for money is the reason why I took one star away! Other than that everything else is great!So I would recommend this, but pay attention to how many connections you are going to use and then multiply the number of connections required by 250-300 (that is a baseline average) to get the total Joules energy rating you would need the surge protector to be, this is got a 1800 joules rating - which is something that is not provided in the item description that is given on product page!.

If I move anything I'll print labels but, a sharpie or masking tape works fine if you don't have a label maker.I've seen some complaints about the power switch failing after a while. I don't anticipate this problem because I'm a set it and forget person when it comes to surge protectors. I check them if there is power outage otherwise, I leave them alone and check them every few months or so. It seems the people who encountered problems with the power switch were turning it on and off frequently. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, just something to bear in mind when purchasing.I certainly think Belkin should redesign the next model and go back to the old style &#34;rocker&#34; switch. It would eliminate the possibility of my cat stepping on the switch and turning it off.  Since this hasn't happened yet, I'm not knocking any stars off.The bar across the bottom helps with cord management and I think it's a useful addition that was simple and unobtrusive.I do think this product is a bit overpriced. I'm not knocking Belkin though. It seems like they have the market cornered with these pivoting power strips. I'm grateful they don't try to rape the consumer like &#34;monster&#34; does.

I had the whole mount fly off the dash when taking a sharp turn. Luckily, I caught it in mid-air. I haven't had it fly off the dash since I repositioned it.- The locking mechanism takes some force to engage. At first, I thought something was wrong with the locking mechanism. It felt as if it might break if I moved the lever all the way over. I received a response from Garmin Support stating that it is normal for the locking lever to take some force to engage. Instead of fully engaging the lock which may lessen its lifespan, I decided to move the lever only about 1/3 of the way. That seems to be good enough to keep the mount in place without any movement.Notes:I wasn't able to find a place that carries this brand new for any cheaper. Even the Garmin Friction Mounts which were available on a particular auction site were more expensive. In addition to Amazon having the lowest price for this item, I recommend purchasing this from Amazon over most other places because of Amazon's hassle free return policy.

I got tired of moving the bb between cars. ( I have 2 GPS units , both garmin nuvi.)They both hold the GPS about equally well.  Can they slide? Yes, but you almost have to try.  The bb is a little slipperier. the bb is significantly heavier.  The silicone has a somewhat smaller footprint and would be superior for packing in a suitcase.  If I do that I will put it in a plastic bag so the silicone doesn't bleed. Some people complained about the silicone leaving a residue on the dash. This doesn't look like much of an issue to me, but my dash is black and I don't care that much.Both are non-adhesive .  The silicone requires a little more positioning. You kind of push down on it instead of just plopping it down like the bb. The bb is probably slightly better for turning between 2 people in the same vehicle, for example for the passenger to enter a new search, without actually swiveling the GPS on the ball mount.They both work fine.  For packing the silicone has the edge.  It is also a little sleeker looking, if that matters. For everyday use, the bb can be moved a  tad easier.  Both are far superior to suction cup..

It also has a lock/unlock knob on the side to lock it in place once you rotate it to where you want.It works great, and it's easy to move the GPS to get just the angle you want, and stays put once in place.

The back part comes as two pieces you bolt together (probably for shipping reasons) and the center deal you see in the picture is just a plastic cover that snaps over it to hide the seem.A word of warning though, bolting them together did not leave the bracket being 100% straight end to end.  When put on a flat surface they were offset a tough with a crown or bow from top corner to top corner.  Consider this when hanging it and USE A 3ft LEVEL!!  Do not, not, not, use the mini level.  Nothing wrong with the level if you leveling something up to a foot long but not this long as their is too much room for error with a short level on a long item.The back bracket is nice though since it could span three studs for me.  It is offset to one side to do so but there was enough room to hit the three studs and still center the tv on the wall, but not necessarily on the bracket if that makes sense.All hardware was fine and bolt long enough.  Didn't need 90% of the hardware provided so don't worry, there'll be extra parts!Tv was easily hung and had no issues.  If you don't know how these work I'll explain as this is the second bracket I've installed and they seem to work the same.  Then all bracket bolts to the wall.  On the top and bottom of that bracket, the metal bends out about a half inch from the wall.  You bolt a bracket onto the back of your tv.  The bracket has a hook at the top to catch the lip of the wall bracket.  This way you can easily hoist the tv up to the bracket, hook it on the wall more or less, and then slide it sideways.  Once in place, on the bottom of the bracket attached to the tv, there is a screw that you then screw up from the bottom that goes behind the other lip on the wall bracket preventing the tv from swinging out and sliding sideways.  Hope this makes sense.  Pretty simple concept. So if the instructions don't make much sense, this may help..

Unfortunately the VESA bolts that come with the TV are too short to use with the brackets, however longer bolts are included in the packaging that worked great. It's always stressful mounting the TV on a wall mount, but assuming you are able to drill the lag bolts into studs, it seems pretty solid. One item of note that has been mentioned before is there is really no good way to get your hand behind such a large TV to tighten the security bolts that screw in at the bottom of the brackets to the bottom lip of the actual wall mount. We were able to get them tightened by one person pulling the bottom of the TV slightly away from the wall while the other person uses a long handled Philips screwdriver to tighten them. I have since purchased a 20&#34; screwdriver just in case I need to ever remove it for ease of use.All in all, great mount, very solid, and easy to put up.

It comes with a level built in to the wall plate and I was made very sure it was completely straight when I attached it to the wall.  After installing the arms for the TV imagine my surprise when the TV WAS NOT level.  I thought I had done something wrong since the level of the wall plate was perfectly straight.  After several tries of re hanging the TV I decided to tilt the wall plate so it wasnt level and try again.  Eureka the TV was level.  So I would recommend before you tighten the wall plate screws to tight to make sure the TV is level. Other than having to spend extra time making sure it was level I am very happy with the product..

The instructions were very easy to follow.  The mount comes with different types of bolts to make sure you've got what you need for just about any tv.  Installation was a breeze as the mount has a built in level and comes with a stand alone level.  Once I bolted the lag bolts into the wall studs the mount wasn't going anywhere.  I put all of my 195lbs of weight on the mount and it didn't budge.  I was able to easily mount the tv to the wall mount by myself.You don't have to worry about getting the mount exactly where you want it.  Just get it close and you can slide the tv left or right on the mount to get the tv into the final position.  Once in position you just tighten the bottom bolts to keep the tv in place.The only "con" I would give it is that it doesn't come with a long shaft screwdriver.  You need one to secure the bottom bolts which stop the tv from sliding left or right on the mount.  It wasn't an issue for me since I have one, but I could see that being a problem for some people.  If you don't tighten the bottom bolts the tv can slide left or right on the mount, so securing the bottom bolts is a must.I'm very satisfied with this mount and my bonus room looks much better now that I've got the tv stand out of the way.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the mount is VERY flush against the wall.  When compared to the 65&#34; mount in the same family, this one just doesn't have a lot of room between the TV and the wall once mounted.  Now, don't get me wrong, I know people pay good money to get their TVs as flush to the wall as they can when mounting them, but I was a little surprised by it because it made running HDMI cables a bit of a pain.Looks wise though, my TV looks stunning against the wall with this mount.  Can't really tilt it much because of how close it is to the wall, but it's solid and this TV isn't going anywhere! To give you a sense of how solid this thing is, once we secured the mount to the wall, I hung on it (I'm 6'3&#34; and 215lbs) and it simply did not budge.  Ended up using different drywall anchors than the ones supplied, but this package provides everything you need, including a decent 10ft HDMI cable, to get this thing on your wall.

Those will be considerably more secure than the sheet rock anchors that are supplied. Installation time should be about 1/2 hour..

In the photo there is a plastic insert that covers the seam in the two plates. Make sure you have a good level and you will have good results - I don't trust the dinky level that is included the the box. When mounting the back plane to the wall, don't forget to use the washers that come with the lag screws as the heads of the screws are smaller than I would have preferred. A socket wrench will make short work of driving these lag screws.I should deduct one half star because the security screws that keep the TV from being accidentally removed from the mount are very hard to reach. In my case, there was not enough room for my hand to get between the 60&#34; TV and the wall to tighten these important screws. My solution was to go out and buy at 12&#34; screw driver extension which enabled me to reach the screws from the bottom. On the plus side, without this extension tool, the TV will be very hard to get off the wall, so tighten them down snugly. My last TV was stolen by a couple of meth addicts who worked on getting my TV off the wall for what had to have been a half hour. The cops caught the scum bags.The included HDMI cable makes this an excellent value and make no mistake the bolted together back plane is very rigid when you get it screwed into the studs.

The manual could have been better instead of a one-page small print. The screws really were of a good quality. They are just painted black, so they may only appear to be of lower quality screws. Couple of things: First make sure you have the tools needed before you begin the project. Make sure you have the wrench for the largest screws in the package used for the wall. The second thing to remember is that there are no Left and Right markings on the two arms. Make sure you install the correct one on the TV.

The TV I got at a local store for around $550 on sale. Installation took about 30 minutes with the help of one other person. Quite easy to install. I would recommend a more professional level be used, however the level that came with agreed with mine at home. If you can drill holes and operate a screwdriver/drill then you can put this up. I am sure that one person could do it, but a second person really makes it easy. Otherwise you would have to hold the metal plate up to the wall while taking measurements. Like I said, doable, but not as easy. The HDMI cable works fine too. Overall I am very impressed with the total quality vs the price paid.

Although I did check the level with my own 24" level.  The HDMI cable they sent also for me was a waste since I already had a HDMI hook up. So I guess what I'm saying is they could give you a stud finder instaed of the HDMI cable and the bevel level. The only time I really needed a helping hand is when I lifted my 42" TV up to slide the bracket on to the hanger, it's a little hard to see the bracket when you're lifting the TV to attach it.

Yes there probably are better ones out there but these work just fine for me. My favorite feature by far is the additional headphone jack under the volume knob. My computer sits on the floor (not enough space on my desk at the moment for it) and I use headphones with these speakers a lot so its perfect for not stretching out my headphone cord. The sound quality is perfectly fine, because I do use headphones my speakers aren't ever turned up full blast, but it doesn't have to be, I can hear it perfectly well. Yes I know I could plug in headphones to computer but like I said cords get hard to reach and having the speakers sitting right next to the monitor make it really easy.I have noticed though lately if I have my cordless phone near the speaker there'd be an annoying staticy hum come from the speaker but that's typical I think and it's not a huge problem for me.The speakers have fallen off the desktop several times, the little plastic parts of the speaker have fallen off but I've always been able to just pop them back into place.Lately I've noticed the volume knob if I pull hard it can pop out. But it pops right back in. I thought it was important to add because if you have pets or small children near the speakers you may want to keep an eye on them in case it falls out on you. I don't know if the knob could be chocked on or not, but just thought I'd share the warning it may be possible if it came out and the wrong person grabbed it....but this probably doesn't even happen a lot, like I said I really had to pull it hard...one night I mistook it for the headphone jack and that's how I got it loosened (it was dark and I was half asleep at the time).That's about it, they're good speakers..

An idea: why not attach these best-selling computer speakers to the headphone "out" jack, thereby freeing my computer from the problem of knowing whether it's, in effect, coming or going, recording or transmitting sound?It proved the cure, but not exactly the charm.  The first thing I noticed was a clear, sparkling high range, a mid-range of sufficient warmth, and a woefully anemic bass.  (I'm not exactly a bass freak--in fact, the sound of the electric bass is frequently offensive to my ears.  But I do expect to hear and distinguish each of the pitches of the acoustic double bass, whether in a solo or supportive "walking bass" role.)So I did the unthinkable: I disconnected the Logitech speakers and tried the iMac's own onboard speakers.  Surprise: not only was the bass really "there," strong enough to be heard and identified regardless of the pitch, but the mid-range sounded just a trifle fuller and the high register was, if anything, bright but not bordering on the occasional shrillness I was hearing in the Logitechs.  The clincher proved the discovery that, seated close to a computer, the user hears about the same amount of stereo separation as is perceived from the two Logitech speakers extended to their maximum.All the same, these Logitech speakers are a remarkable value, so much so that, at this price (especially factoring in the benefits of Amazon Prime), it would be cost prohibitive to return them.  Still, if you're thinking of subbing out the speakers of a new iMac (said by the reviewers to have better sound than my model), save yourself the extra dollars.  You might wish to consider them for use with a laptop, but only if you use such a machine as a "stand-in" for a desk-sized model.  The left-side Logitech speaker, which contains the amplification circuitry, is heavy enough to stay put, but the right-side little fellow, with the on-off switch/volume control, tends to be lightweight and tipsy.In conclusion, it's not all that surprising that these inexpensive overachievers have received high ratings from hundreds of Amazon reviewers, but they could still wind up as gratuitous clutter.  If you have a small laptop, consider the Logitech Z205, a clip-on speaker.  (Three times the price, but even if the sound is no better than the S120 pair, the added convenience, imo, justifies the premium price.)  As for a desktop machine, seriously consider putting out an extra twenty for the 3-piece set with woofer (Logitech S220).  If form is as much a consideration as function, the Harmon Kardon SoundSticks with the glass-like domed woofer are neither outrageously expensive nor sonically offensive (the contribution of the woofer is so subtle it has to be silenced to be appreciated)..

Other webcams, especially in flourescent and other tricky lighting conditions, never looked "natural" to me, even if it was clear what was going on.

At a distance of about 2 feet from me, the webcam covers a nice area behind me, right and left, so keep that in mind before you start your video conversation with someone, if you need some privacy in the background.Though pricier than the others, it seems like a great webcam to me and offers a far superior picture quality to the other webcams I've used and I'm glad I bought it..

About a year ago I bought the Logitech Ultravisionwebcam which, though not at first advertised to do so, was the veryfirst webcam that could be used with OS X right out of the box withno drivers.It's a great webcam despite the fact it does poorly in low light.So, I see that Logitech releases the Quickcam Pro 9000 and by all rights,it is the same compliant webcam as the Ultravision. After all, rightout of the box it does work with Max OS X with iChat.No doubt, the Quickcam 9000 is miles ahead of the Logitech Ultravision,I was amazed by how crisp the image quality was in iChat even under low light.This camera outperforms any webcam I have ever seen before it.....but here's the problem....the frame rate is abysmal. I would saythis thing is working on 5fps and doesn't get any better. Stupid mefor buying this webcam without fully checking all the reviews. Now Ifind that the problem concerning the frame rate was reported to Logitechmonths ago and as usual, there's no fix.I ask this seriously as a long-time user of Logitech products....Why does Logitech hate Mac users?There are very little products the company puts out that are Maccompliant, including their latest and greatest hardware releases. Onlya few keyboards support mac. You won't find a Mac keyboard in theirdiNovo line. Their webcams don't come with OS X drivers.I can almost guarantee you that Logitech will not have a driver forthe Quickcam 9000 under Leopard despite the many complaints posted hereand across the Internet.I just want to warn Amazon shoppers that the Quickcam 9000 has frame rateissues under Leopard.  Do a GOOGLE search and you will easily find enough complaintsto substantiate this claim.If you want a webcam that works great under Mac, try their UltraVision webcams thatcame out a year or two ago.  They work right out of the box with no drivers.  The imagequality is terrific, but not nearly as outstanding as the Quickcam 9000..

Voila!  there it WAS... and I mean WAS, ...  then Windows XP crashed and 6 or 7 hours of trying to just get into Windows..  LOTS of partial boots and watching / counting those little blue bars  left to right 4,  5,  6  and a little hiccup half way across and then right back to memory test  choose SAFE mode OR anything else.  Did several 'restore to previous date' (that did not take). Finally in.  Did an UNinstall Logitech and SUDDENLY there it was _ _ _ _  REALLY the Logitech control panel,  AFTER Uninstall.  and then it was GONE  again and so was Windows.  AGAIN...  a few hours later after several maybe's and almostS, I got Windows again Logitech GONE  Plugged in camera and Windows found it as USB.  Tried to Install Logitech over it and NO Camera found AGAIN.I bought this to Skype with my son , away at school. Was all cranked up, wanting to get this going. Feverishly continued to try to get this thing to work!  It sits there,the cyclops, at the top of the screen, defiantly; like a gargoyle. I am afraid that, IF I remove it, it might JUST keep moving until it winds up in the trash.  Will WAIT for my son to come home at Thanksgiving (2 months) and MAYBE we (he) can figure this out.I have continued to send EMails since.Trying to avoid putting it on my NEW Windows 7 computer.  Actually SCARED to give it a chance to jazz that up, too.  For those FEW moments when anything worked it looked 'promising' but we all should know, what to expect when things "LOOK PROMISING".  G A S P ! ! ! ! This thing has turned me into a borderline pessimist.  Going for a long drive, AND a walk, AND to...... (even mow the lawn?).  RATHER than mess with this.Revised 02 OctAfter several tries  get it running any way you canthen DO 'special install'... BUT ....DO NOT INSTALL the LogiTech drivers.  The added features are a bit 'flaky' then  BUT you at least have a pretty decent camera, THAT WORKS with Skype.  Maybe someday when I have about 12 free hours (for Windows recovery and camera re-install, I MIGHT try the LoogiTech drivers (one at a time).  For NOW, 3 stars, only in comparison to ..... NO! nuthin' at all.P.S.  I dug back and found a 'manual 100" screen" that I rated as a 1 star.THIS was WORSE (too bad they don't allow BOLD!!!)...

The images seen half way around the world are just astonishing (I posted one such image).. People can read the time on the clock at the opposite end of the wall - such clarity!==============================I used to not care much about Logitech - since I'd associated them with the cheaper type of keyboards and a 3 button clumsy mouse that I could not care for. I guess the company has really turned around and is bringing into the market great products at reasonable prices. Now when I see "Logitech" - I'm reasonably confident that I'll find something I like.I have a wireless Logitech keyboard and mouse (works flawlessly) and a speaker/subwoofer set - that also work rather well.This webcam though has exceeded expectations when used with Skype and a high power computer. Skype automatically detected that I have a "high quality webcam" and set me up for "high resolution" video.Costs less than what my CS330 Intel webcam did (and which I used all these years - since no other webcam quite gave me the same level of performance - a creative VGA webcam I tried gave me skin color that was dyed pink - awful).Until now that is -Whats to like -1) Great image quality (good color, contrast, brightness). Its basically like a decent quality 2 MP camera. The color is a bit washed out at the default setting, but the saturation levels can easily be adjusted.2) Has a mic that is extremely high quality and very sensitive. If a sound can be heared at its microphone - it will be transmitted to Skype with full fidelity. We are always being surprised by what the other parties are able to hear - like a baby sucking on the bottle - even though the baby is many feet away.3) I don't know about "RightLight" but I do have to do manual adjustments to brightness/contrast..4) Captures video directly into WMV - if you need to. Video quality is quite good actually. Probably better than an SD camcorder.5) Autofocus seems to work well.6) I loaded the latest software/driver from Logitech site - clear instructions and everything worked first time around - no issues at all. You do need the software+drivers to make full use of the product.7) Lens is much wider angle than my earlier webcam. Make a big difference.8) Echo cancellation is perfect (Apparently Logitech software also has some kind of Echo Cancellation built in).9) Used with Skype - we've had no problems with high resolution video half way around the world and we don't even notice a lag.Flaws and negatives -1)The stand is flimsy. Unit topples over easily if kept on a table. I'll be modding the stand a little bit with a "heavy" weight.2) If you place the camera alone on the table, the perspective is tilted because the mic end is lower than the camera end. Camera cannot rest horizontally. I'll be sticking some foam to the Mic end of the camera to make it rest horizontally instead of giving grandparents a tilted view of our home. I need to make the camera rest on a table sometimes - because of the stand issue (point 1 above).3) Loading just the driver (sans software) - there weren't any options for camera adjustments.4) Logitech webcam software installs itself as a startup. This is un-necessary and I'll now have to "disable" this rotten feature by wading through the registry. Why does software not give me the option of whether it should run anytime the computer is started? One star taken away for this issue!Inspite of the minor flaws - product exceeded expectations.

I have to use another software to do the every minute capture - something Logitech could easily add to their software. The zoom for the camera is useless, in my opinion.

Installing the software was easy.A nice feature is a sound test that enables adjusting the volume on the built in mic to eliminate echos and reverbs. With proper adjustment, a separate headset is not necessary.Another nice feature is RightLight, which automatically corrects the color balance depending on the lighting in your room to ensure the best picture quality. It makes a noticeable difference.Having used cheaper units in the past, I can definitely say that the video and sound quality on this unit is far superior.For basic video calling this unit is easy to use, not expensive, and very good quality. I recommend it.Update: Based on my recommendation, two other family members bought this same unit to run on a Windows XP Pro SP 3 desktop and laptop respectively. They have each had the same positive experience that I have had. We regularly make video calls to each other and other people with ease..

The auto white balancing is also quite accurate, whether indoors in our reds/yellows/browns apartment with incandescent or flourescent lighting, or in the garden of greens and sunshine.Third - the microphone quality was good enough that I threw out my headset based on what my callers were hearing.

This is in contrast with what is experienced on the PC running Windows.

The latest gadget to get a try-out is the Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000.  I've tried other webcams in the past, and they've not been a permanent part of my environment.  This one might just change that trend...The QuickCam is designed to sit on top of your terminal or laptop lid using a rather cool design.  The back swivels out and allows you to prop the webcam in just about any angle you can imagine.  It took me less than five seconds to get it flat and stable on my Sony Vaio laptop screen, and it stays rock solid in one place.  This beats those round ball webcams that always had to be set somewhere on the desk to be stable (you can tell how long it's been since I've been enticed to try out a webcam again).  The software loaded up quickly, and then it was playtime.  The camera shoots from an email-sized 320 x 240 video clear up to an 8 megapixel setting.  When I took photos and captured video, the clarity and resolution were excellent, and I was amazed at the picture quality.On the "fun" side, the software comes with some cool effect settings.  You can set up avatars that will calibrate on your facial features, and then allow the character to mimic your movements.  I also got a kick out of the "fun filters", which do some cool things to the video image.  There's one that turns the video into a grainy black and white film, and it gives your vid capture a "noire" look.  I could see how it would be rather striking for some sort of a documentary or a pseudo-serious video.There are a number of services that the software automatically recognizes, such as YouTube and chat clients.  Therefore, you should have no problem getting hooked into the latest video crazes out there.  And the configuration and setting options are incredible.  The camera can track and pan faces (one or more), so you don't have to worry about centering.  Honestly, you'd have to be moving around a lot *not* to remain on the screen, as the width of the picture is quite wide.  Add in automatic brightness control, contrast, etc., and even a non-expert like me can come off with a decent feed to show the world.  Of course, I'm not giving the camera much to work with, either...I plan on leaving this set up on my laptop with Skype running on a regular basis.  I'll be interested to see how it performs in that realm.  But as of right now, the Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 has earned a spot on my cluttered desk....

The product is so good I just wanted to add my voice to all the positive reviews...PROS:VERY EASY TO INSTALL.1) USB has a sound card built-in. The USB sound card worked without any 'manual' software installation. It is totally plug-and-play (Windows 7). SKYPE recognized the new device and switched over immediately.  After I unplug the USB sound card, SKYPE switches back to the mic (microphone) in my webcam and back to my desktop speakers. Be aware that not all software will be so `user friendly' as SKYPE. You may need to manually reconfigure your software (or reboot) when you unplug the USB sound card.  2) Instead of using the USB port the two separate headset and mic jacks can be plugged into any laptop or desktop. This does not alter any software hardware configuration; I would recommend this for people with laptops that do not know how (or want) to get into their software to change between multiple hardware configurations. Using the jacks simply works. No changing to new sound devices or switching between hardware depending on the software you are using.VERY, VERY Comfortable! This is the first over-the-ears-behind-head head set that I can wear for hours.EXCELENT VOICE CLARITY! Best  ever.  I have had quite a lot of headsets, even ones with ear-buds and mics. The Logitech Premium Notebook Headset is by far the clearest sounding.HEADSET ADJUSTMENTS.  The ear pieces can easily be adjusted for a perfect ear fit.NOT BLUETOOTH.  All the Bluetooth headsets I have used simply did not work very well (both stereo and mono). The voice quality is poor. There is a lag, between you starting to speak and the device recognizing that you are talking. The mic pickups are just not in the same league. ALSO, with Bluetooth there is the software configuration issue when switching between desktop speakers and the Bluetooth headset. But for now, Bluetooth is still second rate versus being hardwired. I would prefer a wireless headset if the sound quality was near as good..

It claims a 2.0 megapixel resolution, and it may actually be that, but the picture (even for still photos) is about as good as a high-end cell phone camera picture.Other issues are:The software updates reset some of your configuration settings and default folders. So everytime I allowed the updates to install I had to reassign my default folders for pictures and video from the Logitech defaults to the ones I wanted to use. I also had to reconfigure the microphone settings every time it updated.The microphone would inexplicably switch from the built-in one to the mic input on my soundcard. (My wife has the same camera for her computer and we have both experienced this problem on our desktop, and both of our laptop computers). It would be fine on a video call and then ten minutes later on another call there would be no mic. The first time it happened it took me a day to figure out how to get it working again. It still puzzles me as to why/how it happens.The update software is too obtrusive...it is too persistent in begging to download the latest updates...there is no option to tell it to ask again in a specified amount of time. Maybe some people like this, I don't like to be constantly reminded by pop-ups when I am working on other things.The Logitech software also does not play well with some other software. If you use Mozilla Thunderbird, the Logitech software will prevent Thunderbird from installing it's own updates which puts Thunderbird into an endless loop trying to install it and then saying that it can't install it. So if you use Thunderbird, you will need to remember to manually shut down the Logitech software BEFORE you go to update Thunderbird.In all, the camera works well, but the software and image quality issues drag an otherwise outstanding product down a couple of notches. But like I said before, this is the best there is on the market and I do recommend it to friends with the aforementioned caveats..

In an area that is not well lite the image produced by the camera is less than acceptable.  The second issue is a result of the camera's inability to measure light reflecting from the subject and not the entire field of view.  When the entire field of view behind the subject to much brighter than the subject the camera compensates for the bright area leaving the subject rendered very dark.  Although this may be compensated by adjusting the software controls on the PC to some degree the overall effect is weak.

Simple, everyone has their computer set up with different configurations & hardware etc.MY long story short, if on a chat site like say VideoFrog, all I had to do to cause a complete FREEZE of not only my cam but my entire system (requiring me to literally UNPLUG THE COMPUTER!), was to simply plug my cam into any USB port. Can you imagine the frustration? Customer support (at MY expense on long phone calls) were in every single case, never resolved. EVERY phone call was going to be returned. How many were? NONE!!!!!!!!! Logitech has become a company of ghosts. Sad because they always treated me so well in past years.How did I finally resolve MY problem? I had to disconnect my Buffalo Wireless Network Router. That is all I needed to do. Go figure. Almost 2 months of being run around in circles. Best of luck to those who like ME, assumed everyone with any config problems was just an idiot...So how does this thing work IF you get it to work? Steller except you need to keep your sound turned WAY down on your mic or you will broadcast the most revolting over modulation you can imagine! Picture? Amazing.

It is only a 2 megapixel camera, lighting is a must.  The Right Light thing works, but the frame rate slows when it is in use, making motion more blurry.  Just turn on another light--in front of you, and I think you'll be fine.Others have had trouble getting it to work with Skype.  I am using this camera on a Vista machine and at first Skype just displayed a screen that was blue, NOT the Blue Screen of Death, but no image, nonetheless.  You need to go in to the settings tab in Skype and choose Default Video Device, and it should pick it up--do not choose the name of the camera, it doesn't work that way some how.Overall, I'm pleased.

All I had to do was decide how high I wanted it to be, locate a wall stud, and drill 2 holes for the lag bolts, one at the mount's top and one at the bottom.  While there are 3 holes on the top of the bracket for mounting, I only needed the center hole to mount the top part of the bracket to the stud. I think the extra 2 holes are for mounting to a cement or cinder block wall.I did use a ratcheting socket wrench to screw in the lag bolts, because it was less effort than using the wrench supplied with the kit.  But the supplied wrench is useful for adjusting the tilt of the tv once it's mounted.The panel that goes on the back of the tv is easy to remove from the telescoping wall bracket portion, I just removed two screws, tilted the panel and lifted it off.I screwed the panel onto the tv back using the shorter set of screws provided which fit the threading, since they went in several full turns, over six, anyway. The tv instructions said they need to go in at least 3 full turns, and to not use too long a screw because it might damage the tv.  Since the 32 inch Samsung tv (VESA back hole pattern 200 x 200) only weighs 19.5 pounds I decided it was good.I pulled the installed wall mount away from the wall, then picked up the tv and hung it easily by myself.  The top of the tv bracket piece slipped back onto the wall mounted portion of the unit, I just reversed the step from when I removed it.  This allowed the mount to hold the tv easily by itself while I replaced the two screws, which must be done to hold the tv mount securely onto the telescoping part of the wall mount.I used the supplied allen wrench to loosen up the telescoping movement of the bracket, because it was too tight as shipped.  I adjusted the tilt of the tv on the mount by loosening the nut on the back of the panel that is screwed onto the back of the tv, and then re-tightened the nut.I can now easily pull the tv away from the wall or push it back close to the wall. When pulled away from the wall, I can easily swivel it for watching from another direction in the room if I am not in my usual chair.The wall mount seems quite strong and secure, and holds the television easily..

It fit on without having to use the extender arms. Instructions are a little confusing but I had read everything I could online and most of the reviews beforehand so I knew what I'd be doing.  It's as easy as finding a stud, but there is no side to side adjustment, so  keep that in mind. I also feel like depending on which way you fold the arms, the tv moves left or right (I guess that's my adjustment!) but to me it just says the tv's not sitting directly in the center of the mount.  It was easy to do and easy to get the tv on. The long HDMI cable was welcome. I didn't use the level because I have a 12&#34; level but I kept this one because it might come in handy, it's a nice touch.  Installs with 3 screws into a stud and feels super secure. The folding mechanism feels nice. The only complaint is it seems like the tv sags downwards (tilt) and I can't tighten it enough to keep it straight... but the tv is high and it's a better angle for us anyway.  The &#34;cable management&#34; feature is okay, but wish it was stronger. I feel like it's going to break after awhile.

Very well made, heavy guage steel used, and an almost perfect design. I took one star off simply because the tilt up/down adjustment is very difficult to manipulate and requires losening a nut on the back of the plate that mounts to the TV/monitor. It is very difficult to do by yourself so having a friend or family member help is ones best bet. Other than that I have no complaints about this product. I am using to mount a HP 2009 series monitor and it seems to work very well. Also came with a 7ft HDMI cable which supprised me (yes it is pictued on the product page but I did not expect it to actually come with it.) and also came with a level (yay for not having to remember to bring one up from the garage!). It comes with a TON of hardware for just about every different mounting config and device.A few tips for mounting on the wall.1.) have someone help you. It is much easier to have one person holding the mount against the wall while you mark your holes with a pen/pencil. It can be done with one person; it is just alot easier and more accurate with two.2.) Predrilling - Predrilling your holes is a MUST no matter what you are installing this into. If you are going into a stud and you do not predrill you WILL turn you 2x4 into mulch. Have fun drilling directly into a concrete wall (it is gonna take a LONG time!).3.) No stud? No concrete or stone wall? no problem! I had this very issue where there is no stud near enough for me to mount into. The anchors that come with the product will NOT hold the weight of the mount plus device in unsupported drywall... do not try, you will not like the results. What you need to do is go to your local hardware store (I went to Lowes) and buy "toggle bolts." I bought some that may have been overkill, but then again do you really want your tv or monitor to hit the ground? I bought toggle bolts that were 1/4"-20 X 2 1/2". If you buy those then the bolt is the same size as what the mount was designed for so no issues! The ones I bought will support up to approx 350lbs EACH. I think my monitor is gonna be ok!Sorry for the long winded review; I just wanted to make sure I did not leave anything out and if anyone needs help or has a question just leave a reply..

I bought two of these for two different brand TV's. The TV's, weighing from 40 to 70 lbs, are easily held up by these mounts. I even did a 'hanging test' by hanging on to the mounts before hanging the TV's. I weigh a little over 200 lbs and the mounts didn't budge. Of course, the weight limit is around 165 lbs so I wouldn't hang anything above the recommended limit but it was reassuring to do a simple hanging test. Installation took around 30 minutes. As long as you locate the wall studs and know exactly where you are mounting the TV ahead of time you shouldn't have a problem. Absolutely make sure the mount goes in to at least one stud for plenty of support. The only small complaint I do have about this product is after the TV is mounted, the 2 secure screws underneath of the mount that prevent an individual from pulling the bottom of the TV out are a little tough to reach. You would need a rather long screw driver to reach them. That being said, I still give this product 5 stars because it truly is a great TV mount and is universal for just about any brand and model.

Mounts at major retailers are $50+ and being a former retail employee I know the margin is HUGE on these items.  The added HDMI cable and level weren't a selling point but a great bonus and since I don't own a level I was happy to have that added confidence when installing the mount.The mount itself is fairly simple to put together, if you have ever played with Legos you probably figured it out sooner than people who have not and decided to read the instructions (meaning the pieces fit together a certain way perfectly).  The biggest trouble I had was with applying the brackets to the TV.  The screw was the right size but was too long and the brackets shifted back and forth on the screws.  I went to home depot and purchased nuts to supplement the gap in the screws.Update: Cheetah reached out to me and apologized for the inconvenience for the screw size and offered me a make good.

The pictures are not detailed enough.2) The pictures were for some other model (step 2), the two horizontal bars have 2 screws that were supposed to use the same tool, but  you need to use different tools.3) The vertical bars used to connect the two horizontal bars came defective. Both have have two screw holes, but one of them on both do not allow the screw to pass. They probably knew about the problem because the screw is completely screwed on one side, but not on the other side. Clearly showing the manufacture could not screw and sold the product anyway.I don't understand why they put this poor quality HDMI cable in the box.

However seeing as how many people had success with it I thought I'd give it a shot. Worked out great. I previously purchased a Sanus wall mount that apparently could fit my 42 inch led tv. It didn't. So I looked for a bigger mount and this fit perfectly. The bars that attach to the back of the tv were literally a perfect fit. The length was right for the holes for the mount on my tv. The metal itself seems pretty sturdy. I've had my tv up for a few days now and it hasn't fallen yet.I didn't get to use the HDMI cable but I'm sure it would have worked fine. I really do like the level that it came with however. Really helpful and now I have an extra one!For 25$ this mount is a steal! The only thing I'm going to complain about this mount is how hard it is to tilt the tv. I wish I could just push it up or down with my hand but you can only adjust it on the back of the tv with a screwdriver.

I will be buying three more of these to mount the other TVs in our home. I highly recommend it. It is solidly constructed and the price is great..

I have full confidence in the mount to hold my 55&#34; plasma TV (which is heavier than the newer, thinner LED TVs). Once the mount was lagged into my studs I hung from it with my full body weight (175lbs).I did not want an articulating mount for this installation because my Plasma TV is already much thicker than newer HD TVs. I wanted a slim profile mount so the TV would hug the wall tightly. This mount fits the bill and has worked nicely thus far (I have had my TV mounted for a couple weeks now).My original product shipment was missing the right upper piece. My package mistakenly had duplicate lower right pieces. I contacted CheetahMount and they did a great job sending a replacement part within a week.I used the included M8 screws to attach the bracket to my TV but I went to a local hardware shop to pick up better lag bolts. I am sure the included hardware is fine, but quality lag bolts are only about $1.50 and I would rather be safe than sorry...My only complaint, and the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is that it is impossible to access the bottom screws once the TV has been mounted to secure the TV onto the mount rails. There is no way I can possible fit my arm behind the TV and screw the screws into place to secure the TV. I am not really concerned and do not think the TV is going anywhere now that it is hanging on the mount but it would offer more peace of mind knowing that those screws are tightened and that the TV cannot budge at all.I have seen others complain about this as well. I am not sure how to solve this problem since it is such a slim mount....

This is a no-brainer buy here folks. I bought this mount for my 55" Samsung TV last year ($1700 bucks!). I mentioned the price so you would be aware that I took a shot with this product on my expensive TV despite its low price. Well, just like I read in some of the more level headed reviews this is a pretty straight forward item. Its a bare bones low profile mount with all the hardware needed to install. Like any project, you can not install anything correctly without the proper tools. I had my trusty cordless drill and appropriate drill bit (in instructions). Located my wall studs and chose the height I wanted. Held the mount up to the wall to get an idea of where it would actually sit. Drilled my holes, and then screwed the first lag screw into place using a socket wrench set. TIP: Screw the first one in just tight enough to hold the mount in place. Then level the mount, which has a level built in already and then finish with the last bolts. I have had this mounted for over a year with no problems. Works great....save yourself the money...still do not understand why other mounts are so expensive! Anyways I finally wrote a review cause I ordered another, lol, :).

Yes, the implements that affix the flimsy frame to the wall are substandard.  Ratcheting one of the 6mm units in resulted in a nice 'snap'.  It wasn't overtightened, nor was it anywhere near the frame.  Seeing the amazing experience that I had with the Sanus mount I used for another room, going cheap here is not the pro play.

I have put a little more than 14 hours of research and 6 hours of non-stop use. I'm not gonna waste my time writing the specs for this device because if you are reading this I assume you already know the specifications, if not you can easily access the Apple website and do your own research. This review is aimed more towards the educated consumer. A consumer, who like me, has spent various hours of the night researching and contemplating his or her next moves.First, I want to start off with the word "tablet", what is a tablet and who needs it? As an avid P.C. user, I tend to define the device as too short, too little. A underpowered, pre-mature device not ready for this day and age. The truth is, their are more people out there who need a tablet versus a laptop. Having a quad core, overclocked, power hungry P.C. I am like most other users; who tend to have a bias when selecting/comparing  portable products. I have been for some time; looking for a laptop with great battery life, portability and power? I first went out and purchased a Macbook pro for about $1199+ some. After a couple weeks of use I was in love. I could not stop showing it off and playing with it. Then I attempted to play games and yes they were playable! But I found myself running to my P.C. whenever I was gonna get serious and then I found myself using my desktop when editing videos. Yet again, I found myself running to my P.C. when it came to doing anything that involved time and effort... It was at this point that I realized that I never used my laptop for more than a hour. Utilizing a mere 20-40% of its power. I used it for; writing papers, showing off pictures and Internet browsing. So I decided to return it. In search for something that made sense.I never considered a net-book useful or even worthy of my time, even less a tablet. The Motorola Xoom came out and I thought it had potential compared to last years 256MB I-Pad. It offers 1GB of internal memory and 32GB of storage space, all for $599. It not only had the potential, but also the power I craved. Although, its pre-mature operating system was a deterrence. This is the same thing that turned me away from the original IPad. Dispite the fact that I liked the original, if people didn't demand it, the product would die and I would be left with a 500 dollar piece of silicon or waste. I needed something portable and practical. I just felt the tablet was a little more practical, if not more useful too because of its  portability and extended battery life. So I took the plunge and got the Ipad 2.First impressions didn't fall short; it was easy to set up, had a beautiful screen, and gorgeous aesthetics. While Apple boasts about its 60,000 app's, I'll tell you what, it's not enough (way better than android though). While you can download IPhone and ITouch apps; they are simply not the same (a 3.5inch app on a 9inch screen). Face Time also seems to be problem, since it cost money for all your friends who don't have an IPad 2 or new Macbook. Tango or Skype are excellent alternatives, but still only supported in a 3.5 inch window. Despite this, it has some killer apps (e.g gmail, calendar syncing, web browsing and etc). My favorite app is TeamViewer, which gives you remote access to your PC from anywhere. This app is simply amazing. I was able to install some programs to my PC from school! While It doesn't support flash, it plays almost every video stream I've seen from the web. Hey, that's all I needed anyways. So I can't complain, but all you flash gamers might.Now I found this whole "touch-typing" thing to be an exasperation. Since I am primarily using this product for note taking, its important I am as accurate as possible. Keys kept skipping and words kept missing. So I upgraded to the Apple-wireless-keyboard.. sigh. It was a well spent 69.00 dollars (cheaper models are available). I am able to control volume, brightness and music. Also makes my tablet feel more like a high end net-book. I want to talk a little bit more about writing. I bought this tablet with the intention of using google docs. Well it works, but you have use the mobile version, which has limited functionality. I tried switching to desktop editing, but it was horrendously slow and unworkable. As a matter of fact I'm writing this with google docs now. As long as you are not using bullet points or etc; you should be fine. I do notice some errors that result from a slow ping, so it's worth trying noting it happens. I could more easily recommend using apple's built in "note-taker". Its responsive, practical and free.As far as "Air-Play" goes, simply amazing. Kind of a pain to set up though. One really has to go into every setting in I-Tunes and mark share libraries under preferences and account profile. When the set up is complete, you simply log in with your I-pad and use the same mobile user name and you are good to go. Of course you have to keep your computer running the whole time unless you have a dedicated server of some sort. Air-paly grants you access to your music, videos and HD collection. which makes that whole HDMI out thing really convenient. Granted its only 720p, Ive never noticed a huge difference between 720 and 1080p Additionally stream times are relatively quick. Just keep in mind this depends a whole lot on your network. Which bring me to my next issue of storage. I honestly feel the only thing anyone needs on tablet is, pictures and apps. Unless you are going on a long trip; a couple movies. I am content and don't think I would ever need an I-Pad with more storage. As far as 3G goes, will its just that. A three year old bandwidth solution. If you can get a tethering plan instead, I would highly recommend it, as you can also transplant GPS automatically when tethering.All in all I'm really content I took the I-Pad 2 plunge. A dive, I really never saw myself taking or considering. Having an android phone and P.C.; it would seem like honeycomb would have made more sense; considering the attractive specs and all. None the less, the IPad 2 meets my draconian standards for 2011. Making any other device look over weight and under-spec'd. While the consensus of professional reviewers have voted the camera insufficient, I could honestly say it does what I need it to do, which is provide fun and entertainment. The rear HD camera is similar to the one installed on the new macbook pro models (2011 refresh). Other than that, I don't plan on taking high quality photos with the device. I might do future reviews with the camera though. check out my youtube channel for video reviews, just look up oceansidecreations..

This means that when you get a map of where you are going later, you can take a screen shot that will go right to your photos (camera roll) and then you can go there and email or text it to anyone else so they have a map to meet you there! You can do this with anything on your screen!!!! What a fantastic tool!Another thing I love that people don't often know about is in the settings, general, accessibility section there are two things you can just turn on and they will read you almost anything out loud on your iPad!  One of them was created for differently abled people and one is more basic.  Speak over and Auto Text are the ones to look for respectively if you'd like to try these! They do take some getting used to.One other thing I learned late in my use of this is that when you are looking at emails, you do not have to open them before deleting them.  If you just swipe your finger across one you know is spam a delete button will come up and you can delete it without ever opening it.I will add more fun tips as I learn them myself!.

Initially thinking that I was buying a new toy, a `novelty', I soon discovered that the iPad2 is much more than that. I use it for dozens of things I never imagined using one for and have become quite attached to it, especially when travelling or just sitting in my favorite easy chair at home.A great deal has been written about the technology and capacities of the iPads, so I will not waste your time reiterating them here. Suffice it to say that this one is the most basic model available. It requires a WiFi connection to operate and its total storage capacity is what seems like a `mere' 16GBs. My focus here is more on my personal experience with my first tablet. I am glad that I waited for the iPad.Being a 65 year old man, my are no longer nimble enough to manage the tiny keys on a Smart Phone nor is my vision acute enough to read things easily on a 3" screen.  On the iPad, however, with its 9.7" screen and keypad that is entirely adequate, I have become quickly facile.The limited memory is entirely adequate as I do not download and keep movies and am not an accumulator of music. The memory is needed to manage the necessary receiving elements of the various applications (Apps) that I choose to install the capacities for. Many are free, a lot of them cost between 99 cents and $3.99 and some cost more. The most expensive one I have is called "Pages" and is a comprehensive word processing and office management suite. Compared to the prices of `installable' programs, this is remarkable cheap. Some of my favorite apps are free, like voice recording capacities and "GoSkyWatch", an App that looks at the night sky through the out-facing camera and shows what constellations are there. It is like having my own telescope.The 20-30 Apps I currently have installed have used about 2GBs of the total available hard drive. I don't expect to run out. The exclusive use of WiFi vs. 3G has a pro and con to it. In the Pro column, WiFi is pretty universally available in most places and it requires no paid data plan to access the internet and use all of the iPad's features. On the Con side of the ledger, the device is usable ONLY where there is a WiFi connection available. With 3G and a data-plan, the iPad can connect from anywhere you can access a signal for your cell phone.At this time, for my own purposes, this basic iPad2 has been a rather surprising delight. I understand that the camera resolution on the third generation iPad is far superior, but what I see on this iPad2 is perfectly adequate for me - and, I expect, for most other people as well.The price is right and the product is truly outstanding..

It seemed like an overgrown iPod touch and nothing more. My mind is now changed. I live in a very rural area and internet service is 80-90$ a month and extremely slow. So I had an idea &#34;hey, what if I use the 3G on an iPad as a supplement to wifi in my area. Turns out Verizon works great in my area and it is only 30$ a month with NO CONTRACT. I had no idea you could get 3G without a contract, for me that really sealed the deal. Now I am using Internet that is actually FASTER then wifi in my area!  Since in am savings 50-60$ a month, the savings will pay for the device in 10months and end up saving me hundreds upon hundreds of dollars. I love it!The Internet is surprisingly easy to navigate and the touch keyboard is much easier to use then I thought it would be. If you are in an area where Internet is pricy and all you really do is surf the web, consider getting an iPad as an Internet device. I am pretty sure you can tether it to a laptop anyways and use Internet.For me, the iPad is an important, practical and HUGE money saving device !!!.

The battery still holds a full charge, and all of the buttons and features still work (I could not say the same about my 4 year old Ipod Touch...).I use it primarily for web browsing, email, Facetime and e-books.This model does NOT have a retina display. Although Retina is nice it makes no difference in day to day use, including viewing photos. So what if I can see dots close up? I am certainly not bothered by them.Sure its fun having the most up to date toy, but having the new Ipad Air would not enhance the enjoyment that I get from the device one bit.Still, it seems like chutzpah for Apple to sell an old model for $400, so if I were in the market, I would look at used/refurbished models.

Since the IPad uses dedicated memory, don't be surprised if the delivery date is extended out a bit since all the parts to put this wonderful device are just not out there.A device that's finally proven once and for all that we can compute different ways, this wonderfully powerful and as always easy to use device is proving why the tablet computer is our next exploding tech market.  Our head guy here at Amazon said in his interview here that we'll see over 40 tablet style computers on the market by this coming Christmas and now I understand why.  The simple fact is much of our time on line is spent simply reading stuff.  Then why carry around a keyboard we're not using?  Be it via Wi-FI or 3G, the upload speeds are simply astounding so we can read or watch videos at speeds that will astound even jaded users such as myself.  Don't look at an IPad 2 as a new computer.  Look at it as a different way of computing.Another surprise with the IPad 2 is in their ability to handle business applications and environments.  The first generation was geared toward those who liked looking chic at overpriced coffee shops.  This model is a real tool - a real computer - a really different way of doing things in the most user friendly and portable way possible.  Do accept the fact that you'll be spending additional dough on accessories such as keyboard, screen protectors, a stylus and more, but thanks to Amazon I've found deals that's made this as painless as possible - actually quite affordable!Do we need one, of course not.  Will our lives be a whole lot more fun and even more productive with one, beyond a doubt.  Don't hurt yourself buying one, but if you're like me and would rather live without pizza and beer twice a month so I can afford my latest toy, then this is something any user will have a blast with in everyday life no matter what you're doing.

They help to define who we are by being a source of connection to the world. An iPad is what has been my connection and has transformed my life exceedingly. It also enhanced every aspect of my life in many unique ways. My iPad 2 is reliable, family/school friendly and has also served as a memory book for me.Apple has been in existence for decades, since 1976, and has grown to become our apple and nutrition of the day providing us iPhones, Macs, iPods and iPads. Apple has become a very trustworthy brand. Before I purchased the iPad on Amazon I needed to confirm that it was going to be worth my time, effort and money. I was blown away by the results of the reviews it had obtained throughout the years. Most of the reviews had given it a five star rating. At that point I knew I needed to buy my iPad 2. I anticipated its arrival anxiously because of the great qualities the product had. In the end, it was everything I had imagined it to be.My brothers fell in love with it as much as I did, or possibly even more. I started exploring my iPad, downloading games and taking pictures. I am amazed at how much one little device can calm and contain children. I have four hyper active brothers and sisters and my iPad has worked miracles on them. They all sit down and as one quietly plays on the iPad, the others patiently wait for their turn. Before my siblings would be jumping and running around everywhere, yelling and fighting about everything. After that point my mom always carried my iPad and she is now buying one for herself. My iPad has become very helpful when it comes to school. I can take notes on it. I complete my homework on it.as type up my essays; watch instructive videos, take educational pictures and much more.  It also converts to a television on weekends. The screen is big enough to watch movies on it, browse Netflix and watch almost anything else. I have grown an emotional connection with my iPad and if you have a family or go to school, I know it will be the perfect product for you as well because it has the capability of helping one though any struggle that may arise.Not only is it an amazing device because of the things it can do but it is also easy to carry around. It is very portable and lightweight compared to carrying a laptop. A laptop does not have the same durability as an iPad. The iPad will hold many memories; it will be like a digital scrapbook that you can easily access and always retain. The iPad memory is what preserves those special moments with your pets, family and anything that is very dear to your heart. The iPad may be purchased with different types of memory according to what it will be used for. Also because it is so transportable it has a great battery capacity, making the life of the iPad longer. Lastly, the iPad's 2 cameras will capture many memorable and wonderful moments. The camera captures clear and vivid images that will last a lifetime.My iPad has been a huge focus in my life. I believe it will be a long lasting item that I will not become bored of or toss in the corner like another abandoned electronic. I will always feel confident in recommending this item and what better place to purchase it than Amazon. Amazon has everything for a better, cheaper price; it is dependable and has the option for fast shipping if needed. My life truly has been blessed by this prodigious electronic. I agree with most people that this item deserves a five star rating. It has been two years since I have bought my iPad and I continue to be a very happy costumer, and will continue to be a consumer of apple products in the future..

Since there is no way to separate the service you get with this device, and the device itself (and once you get this particular model of iPad, you are most likely to be using AT&T; (T-mobile is slower)), this device gets a really unfair rating from me.  Go look at the Verizon version.The good:Easy to use, light, rugged.  Great apps.  The software and apps just "seems to work" as compared to the two Droid phones I've owned, which crash, do weird things, are sluggish when first turned on, etc. etc.  Based on this, I would not recommend an Android tablet to anyone except the most Technoholic Open Source types.The bad: (blame AT&T;, and spineless government oversight)I bought this because I would like to use it if I ever go overseas.  Since Verizon chose to go it alone with CDMA, and the regulators let them do that, you are stuck  in their little prison if you want to switch carriers....So I was told by Apple that the data service would be easily turned on and off like a faucet, and that I would only have to pay for the months for which service was enabled.  Great!  I buy it in December, immediately use it "off-campus" in Albany on Christmas vacation (no internet at my Dad's if you can believe it...)Sometime during Dec/Jan, I call AT&T; to get them to help me figure out why I can not get in to the Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature.  First call was probably 15-20 minutes long, and the AT&T; representative is clueless.  It was like I was asking for help with my Acme Moon Lander.  I suspect it would have been news to the rep that AT&T; actually has millions of iPad customers who pay them monthly.  In fact enough customers that AT&T; should be able to escalate to iPad expert reps.Call two: Again 15-20 minutes, this time the rep is much more adamant that this must be an apple screen (though he could not explain why the AT&T; death-star logo was on the screen I was having trouble with.)Just to play along, I call Apple, and waste some of their money and more of my time.  They quickly confirm this is not their problem.I finally figure out although it would be a nice-to-have to check my account out this way, I can go to their web site, and log in.  It takes me a surprisingly long time (about 20 minutes) to figure out how to "suspend" my service.  By this time, I've waited much too long, and I'm going to have to pay them for January, even though I had not used it then.OK, I pay my bills, and now I get a new bill for Mar 25 thru Apr 25.  Whot?  My service is suspended, why are they still billing me?Now the reason for the dud star: I call AT&T;, and get Rep one.  They are very nice, and explain that even though I have suspended my service, I still have to pay.  What I really wanted to do is cancel my service.  Huh?  This is not sounding too much like a faucet anymore.  She suggests that what I REALLY want is what she calls "Session based" service.  She can not do that for me, but she will connect me with someone who will.I get put on hold where a recording LOUDLY tries to sell me a new Samsung tablet, repeatedly tells me I can  "Re-think the Possible" with AT&T.;  Let me tell you, I've starting to rethink how badly customer service can possibly be at this time.  ....Oh yeah, and there is something in there about not wasting my time too.Rep number two:  I recount my tale of woe,  but she will not have any of it.  First of all, I better get it straight: she does not know where this "Session based" phrase I'm throwing around came from, but I better get it straight.  Its called pre-paid, and we will hence-forth ONLY call it pre-paid, so we both know what we are talking about.  OK lady, you're the boss, Pre-paid.  How do I switch my account to Pre-paid, and how do I get this bill cancelled?  Well it turns out they can not just flip a software switch on their end.  The type of service (let's just call it a billing plan) is determined by my SIM card.  You've got that right: even though it is just a stupid serial number in a database, I've got to haul myself down to an Apple or AT&T; store to get a new SIM card, so that they can bill me differently.Apparently WAY back when, when I first signed up with AT&T; (which I think I did on the phone because the web site was too confusing), THAT is when I went off the rails.  That is why my Settings->Cellular Data->My Account feature gives me a weird error which three different AT&T; reps have not been able to help me with.  This woman was annoyed with me, and clearly thought it was all my fault for getting myself in to this predicament.  ....But she could not give me help with my bill.  Onward:More annoying "commercials":  you know if this Rep loudly read the scripts from these commercials while we waited for the next rep, it would be considered really rude, and nobody would put up with it.  Give me the elevator music please.  I am not calling AT$T because I've got money burning holes in all of my pockets to buy another tablet, I am calling because they are not billing me the way I was promised.Rep number three: I again recount my tale of woe (more quickly this time, so I don't p*ss him off).  Since I'm now in to minute 30 of this call, and that last rep was really testy with me, I'm now asking them to forgive three months for service not consumed.Guess what?  I tell this guy I apparently should have signed myself up for Pre-paid service way back when, and that is why I am here now, and he says: "Oh you mean Session-based service?", and proceeds to use the "Session-based" term that Rep #2 reprimanded me about for the rest of the conversation.So AT&T;: you are just awful.  When I communicate with you, you use the term "Phone Number" when it is not a phone. And I can not make phone calls (or text as far as I know)  You allow me to suspend my service, but you still charge me the same money, whats that all about?  Your own people disagree on what terms should be used for the billing plans.  And we are not talking innocuous terms like "pop" vs. "Soda", because this is how I got in to this mess.  I signed up for the wrong service, and I suspect it is because your poor discipline with terminology.  And that original error message, why give me a mis-leading error, just put up a screen which say "You have got a XXX plan, and this info is not available under that plan".  Cancel/Suspend, Pre-Paid/Session-based. Phone Number/device number.  "Invalid account"/Wrong plan type.  Pathetic. And I mean pathetic, not ludicrous, or shameful, or awful.  Pathetic..

I received the IPad 2 as a gift from my daughters.  When I first opened the IPad2, it was WOW.  Now that I have used it for 2 weeks, here is my opinion.  It SUCKS.  No offense to the IPad lovers.  Here are the reasons:The IPad2 lists at $499 with a puny 16GB memory.  After you load a few apps, your memory is down to say 14 GB.  There is not much you can hold with only 14GB...music, videos, pictures nowadays eat up a ton of memory.  If you want a higher memory, you have to buy the 32 or 64GB, at $599, and $699 respectively.  And even so, the last time I had a 64GB storage capacity is when I had my Atari Computer back in the 80's (ok..i'm exaggerating..but you get the point).  Apple calls 64GB a progress?  And some people hail Steven Jobs as the great innovator?  This is going backwards in time.The IPad storage capacity is NOT UPGRADABLE.  You have to sell the old one and buy a new one.  This is how Steve Jobs made a lot of money, off of a lot of unsuspecting customers.  What puzzles me is why do some continue to patronize such marketing program.There are a few things you can do to overcome the small storage, such as, carry a bunch of SD cards, preload it with files and use the camera kit to view.  Some suggest using an external harddrive which you again have to preload with the files you intend to use.  Others suggest using online data storage which you have to pay, somewhere between $10-30/month, and mind you, you have to be online to access these files...so if you do not have WIFI or 3G access, you are SOL.If I have to do the above to gain storage, what have I gained from IPad2?  I thought the IPad2 is about ease of portability?  Not to mention the additional money one has to spend on the additional accessories.The 3G data capability adds $129 to the IPad2.  Bear in mind, you still have to subscribe to the 3G data.  If you are on the go, the 3G would be helpful.  However, the 3G is not all dependable depending on where you're at.  The 3G signals in China, Hongkong, and Macau were unreliable.  In mainland China, I was able to get "some" 3G data, but none is HongKong and Macau, even when there were strong signals....something to do with prioritization...they give their local subscribers priority, and you get the scrap signal (This is according to T-Mobile).  Maybe this only happens in China.IPad has NO ethernet cable connection.  While it appears that more and more places are now going WIFI, there are still a lot of good hotels using ethernet cables.  Sometimes you have to go to the lobby (a great inconvenience) to get your best WIFI signal (so, being able to use the ethernet cable in the room would be more convenient).  And there are still a few hotels that don't offer WIFI.  Then what?  You are SOL, unless you bring your own WIFI router.  So I ask again, if I have to bring a router for these rare occasions, am I not defeating the purpose of the ease of portability?The IPad2 was not able to open a video clip from my Canon T2i (format is .mov).  Later I hear Ipad only supports apple video formats.  It does not run Flash based content.  It does not run Java.  What the?I still thank my daughters for gifting me the IPad2.  At the least it brought me up to date with technology...I know what I'm not missing...I can say I know what it is...and I can speak intelligently about the Ipad...it's overrated..

I just don't like Apple and their holier than thou and more superior than thou attitude about their products and operating systems.  Our household just got an iPad against my better judgement.  Seems one of us drank the Koolaide.  And as I suspected that person was in for a rude awakening when it came to making the iPad work and play well with others (the rest of the world that is android and windows based) and don't get me started about not supporting Flash.  So if all your friends and family are using iPhones and iPads you will have no problem communicating with them ( well not really) .  Apple has a chip on their shoulder about not invented here.  They have proprietary apps and programs that only work and play well with same ( AirPrint, FaceTime, etc) .  Brother for instance makes one of the most popular and economical mono laser printers in he world and AirPrint does not work with it.  You have to buy an app to be able to print from iPad to Brother products. Fail. Speaking of buying things, you will have to buy the smart cover and you will probably want the back smart cover and an a longer power cord and then a carrying case. Also with all things" I " you cannot add memory, no sd card slot but that's ok you can store things in the cloud.  I don't want to store things in the cloud.  Clouds invariably blow away or want to charge you rent. There's a lot of things to like and a lot of things not to like about the iPad as with any tablet I have seen.  You are paying a premium over the competition to join this club and the iPad is just not as tricked out with ports and interfaces to the real world as I would like.

I have a large family, and every person here uses the iPad on a regular basis. It's been in use for the last 5+ months from morning until night and I am still delighted and amazed with it.I'd never personally owned a tablet before, or an Apple product, but we have multiple computers and all manner of electronic devices in our home and most people would consider me and my family to be techies. Because we have laptops and desktops and netbooks and smart phones, I didn't think that a tablet would particularly add to our level of connectivity or productivity. I was so wrong.Upon opening my iPad2, I was instantly struck by its thinness and its simplicity. There was just the tablet and a charger and a small, welcome pamphlet. I turned it on and it gracefully guided me through setting up my wireless connection. It offered me a tutorial, but I was too excited to bother with that. I was surfing the net within seconds because the interface is so intuitive.By now, there are loads of reviews that go into detail about the cameras and other hardware featured on the iPad2 so rather than bore you, I will focus on some of the real world ways this tablet has changed the way we do things in my home.As a homeschooling mother of a 9 year old, this tablet has made the best things about learning at home even better! The battery life is so good that we keep it with us all over the house. No need to worry about being near a power supply or booting up time or any of that. The iPad 2 is always connected, always ready. There are literally thousands of amazing apps, many of them free, that enrich my child's learning day. He is working on improving his handwriting and using an app that lets him write right on the screen! If he makes a mistake, it prompts him to try again until he gets the hang of it. Math, reading, journaling, science, anatomy, astronomy, geography, music - there's an app for that!Having the iPad2 has meant that whenever my son wonders about something or asks a question about something, we have the answers right in our hands. Remember when you didn't know how to spell a word or a definition in school? Remember how the teacher told you to go look it up? This is like that, only a thousand times better because there is no walk of shame past the whole class to the big dictionary. My son looks up things all day long just because he WANTS to!There are several exceptional music programs that feature an electronic keyboard. My favorite cost a couple of dollars and my boy is now playing music. It translates well, too, because I have a piano and he is able to play tunes he learned on the iPad on our full size piano.Of course, there are games, too. Lots of them. This has been a real boon when we go on road trips. Even though there is no wi-fi in the car, my son has loads of apps to keep him entertained until we reach our destination. No more asking "are we there yet"?I have a 15 month old granddaughter who is becoming very iPad saavy, too. It amazed me that even a young toddler quickly grasps the concept of icons and different apps doing different things. She actually knows how to turn it on and choose the correct folder to find the Fruit Ninja app and successfully launch it and play! There are several other games she enjoys, as well as some delightful alphabet games and story book apps. She also enjoys having us take video of her with the iPad and then play it back for her.I generally have it with me in the kitchen at meal times because I can look up a recipe and have it in front of me while cooking. Or I can watch a movie with the Netflix app while baking or preparing more complicated meals. If I didn't have a Kindle already, I would be using the Kindle app to read ebooks, too. Thanksgiving won't be nearly as tedious for me this year because of my iPad.I now take it with me when I travel instead of my laptop because it fits in my purse! I got a bluetooth keyboard to go with it so even when I need to type a lot, it's no problem (although the virtual keyboard is responsive and quicker to type on than you might think). I spent several days at a hospital with a friend and the iPad allowed us both to keep up with email, google for further medical info, and even watch a movie. I've discovered that there is wi-fi almost everywhere! (That's good because I didn't choose the 3G version.) My friend was so impressed that she bought an iPad as soon as she got home!Even though the device is almost fantastically thin and elegant, I would caution you to purchase and use a case all the time with your iPad. The screen is plenty tough but I have read many, many warnings about dropping it on one of it's corners, which results in the screen shattering. A case is good insurance and many of them feature the magnetic on/off, which conserves battery charge while protecting your iPad when you aren't using it.Other nice, but not essential, accessories are a protective screen film, a capacitive-style stylus, and an extra charger/car adapter. If you will be using your iPad as a replacement for a notebook on a regular basis, a wireless, bluetooth keyboard is nice, too. But other than a good case, the iPad2 needs nothing else to be up and running straight out of the box.Highly, highly recommended..

Installation was a snap and took a matter of minutes per the instruction card which comes with the device as well as accompanying online prompts. There are a huge number of applications available for the IPad and many of them are free; others are available at minimal cost. The learning curve for using this device is fast; if you own an IPhone it is even faster. The platform this is built on is similar in operation to the IPhone. As for installing new apps, I have yet to encounter any installation problems with my add ons, though some people have.If you install the ereader app, it negates the need for a Kindle or Nook. While I'm not about to toss my Kindle, this is a nice alternative to carting around yet another device when I travel.The battery's charge is supposed to last about 10 hours. That is a fairly accurate measure as I've been averaging about 9 to 10 hours before draining the charge.The device's design is truly a work of art. While this is not a very constructive comment re: to buy or not to buy, I'm driven by aesthetics. I'm drawn to attractiveness and functionality. I own a lot of Apple products and their purchase has partially been driven on visual appeal and cleverness, though ultimately i have fallen in love with their ease of operation and their ability to go way beyond most folks'  imagination. What I am trying to say is that even if you buy this blindly assuming that it will do most of the things your laptop does you'll probably be surprised by its many added features. The  Ipad2 is very light and portable. It is easy to hold and with a smart cover or case that converts to a stand, it works great on a  flat surface or a lap. It can slip easily into a purse. I usually carry a small or medium Ameribag and have no problem getting it to fit. In order to keep this pad in pristine condition and safe, I installed a screen protector, a back cover, and a smart cover. For what it's worth, this pad is nifty but I wouldn't try to see if it will bounce if dropped. Additional accessories are readily available such as Bluetooth keyboards, headsets, and external speakers.The 32 GB capacity is more than adequate for my needs. However, an application junkie may need 64GB. I mention this because my son is upgrading because he wants to add more apps and is running out of space. 16GB or 32GB is probably adequate for most users.Response time is robust on this little sucker. While I didn't buy the 3G model, I haven't had a problem attaching to free WiFi and reception has always been good given that I'm usually in populous areas.The pad's sound quality is good as well as the screen's image. The camera is o.k., but I prefer my IPhone's camera or better yet a high res dedicated camera.While I had no previous experience with IPad's first incarnation, IPad2 seems to be an improvement over the first release due tofaster processing speed and a lighter and more compact design. While there is no slot for an SD card, I suspect that subsequent IPads will feature better and/or more sophisticated cameras and video conferencing capabilities, and an SD card slot among other things.Bottom line: the IPad2 is a fantastic device that is more versatile  than a netbook but lacks some of the functionality of a fully integrated laptop. It's compact size and light weight is a big draw as is its ease of operation and performance..

The consensus of CNET, Engadget and most other tech reviewers is that the Motorola Xoom is the closest competitor, but falls just short of iPad.This latest version of iPad sports a thinner design, front and back camera for casual filming and FaceTime/Skype video calls, a gyroscope, better speaker and, of course, a dual-core processor and 9x faster graphics capabilities. You still get the 10 hour battery life, but it's all wrapped up in a nicer package. That said, it doesn't seem drastically different than the original iPad and it feels like this version is simply an iPad with cameras, and the cameras don't perform especially well.Granted, the increased graphics capabilities do make a noticeable difference in the handful of games that take advantage of the increased speed ("Infinity Blade", "Real Racing 2 HD"), but most of the apps I use most frequently - e.g. CNN for iPad, Netflix, ABC Player, iTunes Video, iBooks, Pandora, SiriusXM, Apple Remote - don't feel like the user experience changed much beyond the increased volume coming from the speaker.My big disappointments with the iPad 2 are that the cameras aren't great, though that's forgivable since I'd use them mostly for video calling anyway, and that the screen didn't increase in resolution from the first generation iPad! I want my Retina display!However, overlooking the faults of the iPad 2, it's still the best tablet on the market, in my opinion.My kids love the educational apps ("Monkey Preschool Lunchbox", "First Words Animals", "Shape Puzzle HD", "Talking Larry", "Peekaboo Barn" and "Garage Band" are all highly recommended), and I think they've gone a long way in teaching even my mildly autistic daughter memorization and puzzle solving skills!I also love that I can get paid content from apps lie Netflix, (Comcast) Xfinity TV and Hulu+ and even free content like on-demand "Bachelor" episodes and other shows from the free "ABC Player" app. There's just so much capability available to the device through apps and certainly, the wealth of apps available in the App Store is one of the iPad's biggest strengths vs. competitors!It's also a great device for checking email and casually surfing the web, as long as the site you view doesn't require Flash, which is still unsupported. I used to have a netbook that took 5 minutes to boot, then had an awkwardly small browser window and slow response, but you see nothing but instant-on capability and smooth navigation with iPad. I'd definitely prefer this tablet to a netbook!Also, a couple of other miscellaneous tips for those interested:1. The new magnetic Smart Cover from Apple is a must-try! The automatic wake and sleep on opening/closing the cover is more handy than you might first think, as is the ability to roll the cover into a stand for the iPad! We watched Netflix from bed while my wife nursed our baby recently, and it would have been a pain without the handy stand!2. If you buy anAirPort ExpressorApple TV, you can wirelessly stream music (and video in the case of the Apple TV) to a remote set of speakers using AirPlay or the Apple Remote app! It's cool to be able to listen to my iTunes content from my kitchen with the iPad as remote control!3. If you're debating whether to buy the WiFi-only or the WiFi/3G iPad, it's worth noting that by paying for the WiFi hotspot capabilities on an iPhone 4, you can not only get data, but location services for your iPad 2, so you can save a couple hundred dollars on hardware and future-proof your connection speed since you can buy a new phone instead of a new iPad to take advantage of increased network speed.In summary, I highly recommend the iPad 2 if you're in the market for a tablet. Its apps are highly entertaining, portable and easy/quick to launch a play, and it just may change the way you surf the web and check email! Even your kids will love it!The few innovations this model sports aren't what they could have been, but are nonetheless compelling..

This is certainly due to the fact that the KINDLE is FAR superior to their crappy iBooks selctions, and Apple is trying--illegally in my opinion to restrain E-Book Commerce, and should be met with swift Legal Action.  This change will make it much harder to buy Kindle Books directly from the mobile device itself.  They have also done this to the Barnes & Noble Nook Application also, but as you might guess--they haven't done it to their own iBooks.

The touch screen is both elegant and accurate to the exact point of your finger. Also with the new A5 dual-core 1Gz processor this will surpass any applications. However im telling you all the pros about the product and I'm not one of those all out apple fan boys I believe every device out there has a purpose but some are more worthwhile for your money.Cons: Despite all the good looks and great hardware and software the device is fragile and you must buy a case for it or its prone to scratches unlike most android device they have a much more durable glass one known as gorilla glass. Also the camera isnt even barely a megapixel the quality of the images are horrible and you have a vga front facing camera.Overall: this is a great buy because the amount of application offered from apple's App Store benefits you more than Androids app store.

It was pretty dirty and wet, but still. Lucky me!Nothing was really on it, just a video about drunk idiots and a tractor. So I decided to keep it.Ever since then it has served the wonderful purpose of being an entirely mobile computer in and of itself. Take it everywhere with me, plug it into any computer I need, and just boot Linux off it. Great! I loved it so much I decided to buy another one (8GB) for my eBooks and such.As you can see, the card is EXTREMELY tough (don't try to test this, though ;P), seeing as it survived a lake full of people, getting wet, and caked over with clay and mud.

The only thing the Touch lacks is a GPS reciever.  Sure, the IPhone has that, but it also has a data plan requirement that I just don't want to pay for.Many people have complained about the quality of the camera built into the 4th gen Touch.  While the picture quality isn't that great, is fine photography something you were really expecting to do with something that isn't a camera?

I've been having fun with it ever since, installing mostly free apps, watching TWC television shows on it with closed captioning, reading my favorite Life Application Bible on it (although using all the features of the LAB can be frustrating because the IPod Touch is small) & a few other books I downloaded to the Kindle App, surfing the web, learning the constellations & viewing the stars & satellites,  playing games, especially word games when I'm waiting for anything. I've even been known to take the IPod to bed with me to watch science & history programming. Even though the screen is tiny, I haven't had any trouble reading books or watching TV or videos on it. Like I said, I'm having lots of fun with it. I have a movie ready to sync to my IPod, but it will use up a lot of space so I'm holding back on it. I'll be adding some of my favorite music soon. I've taken photos with it too.  I need to try the HD video recording the next time I visit my grandkids. As soon as I can talk my daughter-in-law into using Face Time, I'll be trying that out too. I'm anxious to use AirPlay but don't have any devices to support it. I dock it to my portablePhilips Fidelio DS7550 Rechargeable Portable Docking Speaker for iPod/iPhone (Aluminum/Black)& listen to Christian radio stations too.

I set up a passcode so someone can't just pick up my IPod Touch & start using it...although I don't think this is secure enough & I'm not ready to enable restrictions. I'm not using a stylus, but might try one to see if it makes using the features on the Life Application Bible easier.There's about 6.4GB of space available on the 8Gb IPod for adding apps, movies & music, etc.I'd rather enter my email password manually, but I can't find that option. It seems I have to store the password in my IPod. I'm considering taking my email account off of it. The included Apple earphones are huge & very uncomfortable. I don't like them. It also comes with a dock connector to USB cable (use this cable to attach the IPod to your computer to sync & charge it).After doing quite a bit of research, I purchased anOtterBox Defender Series Hybrid Case for iPod touch 4G (Black/Red). I don't need any screen protectors with this case & it's supposed to do a great job of protecting the IPod. Also, I find using theAmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices Including Kindle Fire, Apple iPad 2, Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy Tab, BlackBerry PlayBookmakes navigating theLife Application Study Bible NLTeasier on my IPod Touch, otherwise I don't really need a stylus. I find that when I use the Touch's keyboard that if I touch slightly in front of the letter, I'll hit the right one.Now I understand why kids love these things. So far my only gripes are the huge earphones & the fact that I can't enter my email password manually.  I suggest searching the internet to find answers to your "IPod How To" questions. I've  already learned several hints & tips..

Since I feel there is probably many people in my position (have an iPod but on the fence about upgrading). My review will be written from this point of view.My biggest complaints about my Old iPod are as follows:I dislike using iTunesNavigation of Tracks, Albums, and Artists is difficult with the click wheel (especially while driving)Screen size impractical for viewing videoEasily ScratchedThe latest iTouch addresses all of these problems with the acceptation of iTunes. Still not a big fan of using iTunes but unfortunately most of the alternative are just as bad. If only iTunes was as intuitive as the iTouch itself I would have zero complaints. Navigation on the unit is way easier with the touch screen and the digitizer is extremely accurate compared to other touch screen devices I have owned. In addition the voice command option is fantastic and much more accurate than I had anticipated. Using voice commands while driving allows me to hear the music I want without looking away from the road. The screen size is great (almost as big as the device itself) and being able to switch between portrait and landscape by tilting makes the large screen more practical to use. In addition the resolution of the new Retina display is amazing, it is almost impossible to make out individual pixels ...it just looks perfect. As for scratches, the glass on the screen is virtually un-scratchable. I accidentally left it in my pocket with my keys and not a single scratch (the metal on the back of the unit is just as easily scratched as on previous models). This would have certainly scratched my last iPod and in fact video was almost unwatchable on my old unit because of all the scratches. Now I watch streaming Video from Netflix and the picture quality is fantastic.Some of the bonuses of upgrading:I didn't really need a camera option but the camera quality is very respectable. I also love the Wi-Fi Capability and the range on the wireless is very impressive considering the small profile of the unit. Of course the Apps are the charm of this unit. It's just like taking an iPod and making it more fun and that is the point after all. I also like that there are apps that let you change the way you organize your music. It was good of Apple to allow this instead of being forced to use what is equipped in the iOS. Now if they could make an app that makes iTunes more practical, I'll be set..

The one thing that I have been missing/wanting is having a built in camera. I recently saw the photos taken by a friend's iPhone and was blown away by how good they were. Almost all reviews have said the iPhone built in 5MP camera is excellent.  Like many others I watched Steve Jobs present the new iPod line today and was very excited to hear that it had all the features I was looking for. Retina display - awesome. Front and rear cameras - yes! Finally.I was all set to order 2 from Amazon the minute Amazon had them listed. But .. while looking thru the Apple website I came across the specs for the rear facing camera. It is only .7 megapixels. Less than 1 megapixel. What? I thought that can't be right. I contacted Apple and the rep, who had gotten many such calls it seemed, confirmed that the iPod touch has  a very different camera (.7 MP vs the iPhone's 5 MP) . Bummer. I looked around and found a hands on review of it .... and they said the sensor itself, besides being lower MP, is also not nearly as good as the one in the iPhone. Not terrible but certainly not good and no where in the same league as the one in the iPhone.The camera was one of the 2 main things people asked for. The other being the Retina display. My assumption is that Apple didn't want to affect iPhone sales and purposely dummied down the camera. Shame on them. They want us to pay $240 to $400 for an iPod with a terrible camera.I first predicted that w/ the Retina display and the camera that this would be a smashing success, a huge seller coming into the holiday season. I suspect when people get them and see how bad the photos are, they'll be returning them to Apple. Or like myself, not upgrading.I realize this review should be for a product I own, but I felt it was important for people to know about the camera before they ordered it. If photos aren't a big deal, and you'll only email them or post them on facebook, then .7 MP is probably fine. If you want to print any of the photos you take, or even have room to crop the photo, you won't get enough resolution to do that.That being said, the Retina display does look awesome, but is it worth the extra dollars over the price of the 3G model? Only you can decide that.I hope this helps all of you make a wise decision about your purchase.08 Sept 2010 UpdateHello everyone. First, I am glad that my raising the above issues helped many of you. Second, for those who lashed out at me, perhaps you should take a look at why you get so angry at a stranger who simply encouraged you to look and think before you buy.Here's an update.[...] has posted a hands on review of the new iPod Touch. You may want to google it or go to their site to read it.In summary:1. Retina display is darker and not nearly as good as the one in the iPhone. "Definitely not an iPhone w/o the contract".2. HD Video is actually pretty good3. Size is a lot smaller than the 3g, bad if you have normal or large hands, ok for teens and those w/ small hands.4. Photo quality is much worse than the iPhone. And their posted photos show how much worse. Forget trying to print them and I'd argue not even good for the web based on their samples. No focus or zoom capability either, you can only adjust brightness.There you go. We are staying w/ our 3g models, there isn't enough here to justify taking a huge loss selling them and buying these new models. And given that the camera and retina display aren't nearly the quality of the iPhone, this is certainly a release we'll sit out.I hope this has helped..

I took the iPod to a local electronics store and found that it will not interface with ANY docking devices (all of which are iPod-certified). Only the USB cable that came with the iPod will fit into the docking port. Now that more than 30 days have passed since placing the order, I am unable to return the iPod to Amazon.com. I have now purchased one speaker dock that cannot be used with the iPod and I paid for this iPod, which is not fully functional. Obviously I am very disappointed. Previously I had purchased less expensive MP3 players but this time I spent the additional money for an iPod due to expected quality.

So since I don't own a smartphone, as I believe the whole contract system is a scam designed to steal money from stupid poor people, I thought this would be a great opportunity to buy an itouch. Generally, I absolutely love my new itouch, but there are a few caveats. First and foremost, the battery life is pretty abysmal, especially when you have the screen at an appropriate brightness, wifi on, and games playing. If I use the itouch, I pretty much have to charge it every night, and that's kind of annoying. Another problem is that the camera absolutely sucks, every picture I've taken has been blurry and grainy. However the video is pretty decent. The screen is beautiful, but it could definitely be a little bigger and the sensitivity could be a little better. So far I have no complaints with the sturdiness of the itouch.The biggest problem that I have with it, is that when listening to music I can't skip or repeat a song without unlocking the itouch and hitting skip. Yet the itouch has two big volume buttons on the side, which I don't really need as I don't really change the volume on the fly. I would love if I had the ability to switch the buttons. There's some other small things I'd change, but that's essentially it.I love all of the games available for the itouch, I've had lots of fun with many games for less than the price of one Xbox 360 game. Other than that, I still love itunes and the music playback on the itouch..

Not only does it play music, but it can surf the web, download and run apps, take pictures all on a beautiful high resolution screen. Although the ipod touch is pricey, you are getting what you pay for. The user interface on it is amazing. Im almost positive you'll know how to navigate through your ipod touch without instruction and with ease. The touch sensitivity is perfect, all you have to do is simply glide your finger across the screen, and your off to exploring your new ipod touch. As far as build quality goes, the ipod touch is very fragile, so i would suggest getting a case for it if your known to drop things or for just extra security. The battery is exceptional, probably the best out of the ipod series. it gets 40 hours of audio playback, approximately 7-8 hours of video playback and use of wifi. And about 5 hours of game play. The new retina display with a resolution of  960-by-640 looks gorgeous. The human eye cannot even depict each individual pixel. The camera quality is decent, it shoots great video and picture when outside in a sunny area, but when not in that environment it can be very hard to take any good quality photos or video. But keep in mind that this is not a camera with an ipod, but an ipod with a camera. The 32gb model i would say is just the right amount of memory for all people, whether you listen to a lot of music and download a lot of apps or not. The 8gb actually only has about 6gb of storage so after you download a few hundred songs and a couple apps, all your memory will be gone. I'd say its better to be safe than sorry because the storage capacity of the ipod touch cannot be changed once you get it. So that concludes my review, i hope you guys found it helpful..

I know people are raving about it and can't wait to get one, just cannot figure out why. My mp3 player broke and I needed a replacement. Wanted the Zune as I am a musician and audio quality was the most important issue for me. Found they are not making any new ones and only updating to the new Windows7 phone.As far as the ITouch 4, the display is very nice and looks pretty. An easy machine to navigate around. Internet access is fine, nice to get my mail now and then, and it has a couple of nice apps for music. Most apps are totally useless, a lot of nonsense games, and most apps are "I'm wasting my time" apps, at least that I have found. The "find a restaurant" app is good, there are several. Stanza is a good app if you want to read some ebooks and you can upload them from your calibre collection. It is not close to a kindle but will do in a pinch. You eyes do get tired from the contrast.The absolute worse thing is the battery life, there is none. It does not even last a day!! This is unacceptable to me and I have no idea why people have not been screaming about it. They just accept it and shrug their shoulders. I spend more time charging the thing the using it. My little mp3 player from lasted a month. And I can tell you, as long as people accept this terrible situation, it will not change.As far as the music, well...........if you are an audiophile forget it. I have tweaked and have the best ear buds and it is just barely acceptable. There are several cheaper little mp3 players that sound so much better. The external speakers are useless. So if you want this to listen to classical music, you best keep looking. Now that they are no longer making the Zune, it is a dilemma. Needless to say I was very disappointed.So, now I have an expensive little mail getter and will look elsewhere for something to play my music.Speaking of mail. If you set up a pop account you are okay, but if you have Gmail or yahoo or any of the other mail clients that uses imap, it will delete all your mail in your mailbox on your computer. I know, it deleted mine and you cannot get it back unless you forward it to a different address. It works fine with the pop mail addresses. So make sure you check it out.so overall out of 10 at least in my opinionlooks pretty  10easy to navigate  10battery  -1music  2mail  5apps  3pictures  5ebook  6internet  7.

Just like most shoppers on Amazon, I read the reviews from people who have tried the product which helped me decide to get this one. The frame is constructed with plastic material and the rubber grip looks and feels identical to the material used on the Nikon D700. They are a perfect match! Installing it was easy without reading the owner's manual. I was able to use my old Nikon D80 batteries including generic brands. I find the built-in cursor to browse the camera menu easier to use than the D700 which may prevent wear on the cursor.It came with the AA battery holder that can hold 8 rechargeable batteries. I tried using the AA battery tray to test if the camera can achieve up to 7fps (d4 under shooting display and select 7fps). This feature "works" if you want to experience the higher fps capability of this camera. Test was conducted using a Nikon 50mm f1.4D lens, jpg, S size, CH mode, indoor using fluorescent lights/incandescent lights, and Eight AA rechargeable Energizer Nimh batteries.With the battery grip on the D700, it fits perfectly on my large hands, and in my opinion, it made it much more stable to shoot hand-held. The added benefit in getting this battery grip are: increased fps provided that you use 8 AA batteries with the included tray/holder, however, you must disable or change some of the camera setting such as the Active D lighting, set a1 to "release" priority instead of focus priority, use a fast lens, and longer shooting time especially if you like to view or edit the images frequently or if you use live view a lot.This product is a winner IMHO and will save you money compared to the original Nikon grip. It doesn't have the Nikon quality and it is made in China. The box claims that it will work with the Nikon D300 and D300s. I don't have neither one of the D300 or D300s, so I can't verify this for you. This is a sweet addition to my bag. Get one! I highly recommend it. But if you have smaller hands or if the Nikon D700 body is already too big for your hands and don't want the extra weight, don't get it. Moving to full frame is already expensive, you'll save some cash if you get this product instead of the original Nikon product. I don't use my camera on long hikes or for professional purposes, so this suits my needs.Edit: If you are still curious, I've posted some pictures above with the D700 to give you an idea on how it looks like with the D700 and 70-200mm VR..

I figured for $50 (instead of about $180 for the MB-D80 oem), I'd give it a try on my D90. I tried a MB-D80 battery grip on another D90 and so I know how each feels and looks.I am very pleasantly surprised by the build quality of this product, and I feel it is actually a little better than Nikon's. The Zeikos rubber grip is a little softer and lends me to believe it has a little more grip on moist hands than the Nikon's harder rubberized grip. someone said the rubber smells bad, it smells like rubber to me, with no overly bad smell.I gave the product 5 stars overall, but 4 stars for appearance, because it is slightly larger (not much) than the MB-d80 and makes the D90 look a little like it's on steroids. It matches well, with the Nikon, but is slightly bigger and bulkier and noticeable to me. I think it screws on tighter and a bit better than the MB-D80 imho.other than that, it was an easy install, exactly like the MB-D90 even had the holder for the battery  door on the battery insertion part of the grip. The sideways shutter works fine might be a little lag), the 1/2 shutter release works just like camera. Master and rear control wheels work perfect like camera opening/closing aperture and shutter/ISO speeds (someone said they didn't work, but mine works perfect). The master and rear control wheels are slightly "looser" than the camera controls, but not bothersome in any way but noticeable. the D90 recognizes both Nikon lithium batteries in menu. I have not tried with regular AA batteries, but the battery holder slides in nice and tight. I have not experienced battery drain like another user (i would tell them to check their battery, as I had a new battery go bad and it would drain after about 30 shots or a few hours). Have had the batteries in camera for 2days now of about 150+ pictures a day with and without flash, and battery icon still shows 100%. Overall well manufactured product imho, and i would recommend this for anyone..

I submitted a photo that shows how well it fits with a Really Right Stuff quick-release plate as well (not an L-plate, but I'm using it for video and having used some other RRS L's, I feel like it might possibly work). Yes, it makes your camera heavier obviously, but it counter-weights big glass like the 70-200mm f/2.8 or 24-70mm in a nice way that allows better focus control on your lens hand. Not sure what the official Canon might offer over this unit since I haven't used it (perhaps some weather-sealing, etc?). But for a much lower price, all the buttons work fine and connect with my external flash on radio-control without issue. Plus it roughly doubles my battery life which is the main idea. I've seen some reviews on here state that the battery door lacks grip: Not sure if I have a newer model or what, but there's definitely grip on mine.

The wheel that you use to tighten works fine, but you can jiggle it back and forth.  This does not affect how it fits at all.  It doesn't mean that the grip is coming loose, its just how it is. It comes with an optional insert for AA batteries if you don't happen to have a second lithium battery charged.  I also like how it has the shutter button, AE-L/FE-L button, and front and rear dials as well as directional buttons to control the menus while the camera is vertical.I honestly did not know if it would be a fully compatible grip for that price but I was pleasantly surprised.

Suffice to say, I really like the battery grip's capabilities thus far.I have only one complaint. I use a Manfrotto quick release on the bottom of the camera and have a R-strap attached to that. With these two things on the bottom it makes it a bit awkward to use the grip's shutter release. Thankfully my hand and fingers are long enough and I don't see this being an issue, just more of something I will need to become used to.The build quality of the Zeikos is light and strong. The grip itself is a little large (I wouldn't recommend it for a girl with small hands) but feels good in my hand. I have medium sized men's hands and the grip works fine for me.If you're having issues using it, make sure to read all the instructions. Especially the part about the Control Lock.

But I've found that's it's less than perfect and probably deserving of the discounted price point.I bought the 7D a few months after it came out and subsequently purchased this batter grip.It feels great in the hand and makes the camera much easier to control, particularly when shooting in portrait. For this I'd give it 5 stars.The problem I've had with it is that it all of the buttons, except the shutter button, will randomly stop working and then randomly start again. I'll be in the middle of a shoot, change my focus point...wait, it stopped working again...ok, where's the button on the camera. Some time later it will start working again. The exact same thing happens with the wheel. It'll work, randomly stop working, and then start again.But my biggest complaint is that yesterday the shutter button stopped working all together. It worked great on Saturday, but then on Sunday, testing for a studio shoot, I noticed the autofocus wasn't working. Ultimately it turned out to the the shutter button on the grip. So...I'll need to find time to tear it apart and see if maybe it's just dirt or something blocking the contact or maybe it's really dead.Unfortunately I have a big shoot this weekend and need/want the grip for it, so I went ahead and ordered another one. Even though the first failed, two of these are still cheaper than one of the Canon. However, should the second one fail then I'll be saying I should have gone with Canon to begin with.

I'm one that likes my gear to be heavier rather then feather light as it just makes me feel better about what I'm holding. Installation was a breeze once I figure out that removing the battery door was a simple as pulling it off at a 45 degree angle. I have not been able to compare this to the Nikon grip, but I would imagine that Nikon's uses the same heavy plastic in theirs. You can tell this one was constructed with lighter materials, but considering it's what, 1/3 the price of Nikon's, it's a very good buy. Aesthetically it looks like it belongs there as well as an add on grip can. I like that there are actual rubber grips where they should be.Update: I first have to admit that I am a hopeless consumer, and when I had the opportunity to see the Nikon grip and try it out, I felt compelled to pick it up. After having my Zeikos for about 6 months, I've noticed some issues that began to rub me the wrong way. The rubber grip has begun to unstick, not horribly, but enough for me to notice and worry about what it would be like in another 6. If it did...sure, superglue would work I'm sure, but I'm a bit ocd about my stuff. I also noticed the lettering on the ae lock was almost gone. Again, not a catastrophic issue, but annoying that it's happened after 6 months of moderate use. My next gripe became the finish of the Zeikos compared to the Nikon. The Zeikos appeared somewhat textured, but still rather smooth, and didn't quite mesh with the camera body. Now bear in mind, these are all faults that I found to justify picking up the mb-d80. None of them are massive issues, and are not worth $100. The issues I have had that while still not worth an extra $100 but some what more note worthy are these: The Zeikos does not adhere to the camera body as well as the Nikon. There's an annoying amount of play that I had to fix by using a few strips of duct tape around the part that extends into the camera's batter compartment. There's a wee bit of movement on the mb-d80...might still wrap a single strip on. My next actual concern was the responsiveness of my camera buttons. For some reason, with the Zeikos attached, I often had to push the play or info buttons a couple times to get them active. Not so with the Nikon. Worth $100 extra? Not likely, but frustrating none the less. The battery door feels more solid on the Nikon, and there is a slight difference in weight between the two with the Nikon being the heavier of the two. The final difference I've noticed, and this is honestly what sold me, is the texture of the plastic. The Nikon feels a bit more rugged, and looks like the same kind of plastic my d90 is made out of. Oh, and and the buttons and dials on neither unit match those on the camera very well. The Nikon's shutter release might seem "spongy," but if you're used to the half/full push feeling, you'll get over it quick.With all this said,  now owning both grips, I will say that the differences between the two may only add up to being worth the extra money if these issues really matter to you. They do to me, so I will keep the Nikon on, but I probably could have used the money elsewhere, and my pictures would still look the same. If the Nikon retailed for as high as $120, I'd say it's a sure shot over the Zeikos, but the price difference can make it hard to justify. Hopefully this is helpful..

I'm 6'2" and suffice to say, I have relatively big hands. My T3i is fairly averaged size, and my hands always went well beyond it. I appreciate the added grip that this supplies the camera, as well as balance. My pictures are the same, as I'm not going to BS and claim they come out better etc etc. This DOES however, allow for better balancing due to having more grip, better weight distribution (this adds a little weight) and a more overall balanced feel.Also, you can add 2 batteries in this grip.. Not one, but TWO. That in itself is immensely helpful, as I can now shoot a solid ~2,500 photos without auto focus and flash. The added battery power absolutely ensures that you will have more than enough battery power for your photography sessions. I for one, greatly love the extra battery power, and plan to make good use of it. I already charged my camera probably once a week, but with this.. I'll be charging once every 2 or 3 weeks now. Assuming I don't take shots every day, of course.This is also very aesthetically pleasing and makes the camera look more "professional" so to speak. I was very impressed with how well made it appears and how well it blends in with the camera. I honestly can't tell a difference from this and the $100+ ones by Canon. The rubbery grip style on it is great and it feels really well made overall. It doesn't feel clunky or cheap and plastic like.If you are on the fence about getting a grip, don't be! Don't even think about it, just get it. The benefits definitely outweigh the odds. And, lets face it.. This grip isn't gonna break the bank. Not to mention, buying 2 cheap batteries on amazon to pair with it aren't gonna break the bank either. If you want "Official Canon" products and feel the need to get an OEM Grip + Batteries, enjoy spending up to $300 on it. I'll enjoy the fact that I spent only $45 in all for that..

As expected it worked flawlessy!  The AA's lasted all day long but were exhausted at the end.  I shot over 1300 frames of the dog sleds, plus LOTS of landscapes.  Once the AA's died, the camera (D700) switched over to the ENEL3A battery automatically.What a great product!!!  Get it.  You won't be disappointed.  The extra 3FPS you will pick up are well worth it!I've had mine for about a month now and I waited until I returned from a weekend of motor sports shooting to post.  That was going to be the true test of this product.  I used the battery grip during my trip in mid-August on a family vacation but that was mostly beach and summer fun family shooting opportunities.  I LOVE the vertical shooting button.  Extremely convenient.  The only downside of using the vertical grip is the that the whatchamacallit on the Zeikos -- used to move the focus points around, is a bit small for my large fingers, and kinda mushy for my tastes.  That is my only complaint and I must say if this thing breaks, I'm gonna cry first, then re-order another one before my tears are dry :)  I'm sure the "real" one from Nikon is sturdier, but for the price I paid I could buy about four for the price of one Nikon unit.Anyway, I shot with the grip, and the eight AA batteries installed in order to get the maximum frame per second rate.  WOW.  Not only did it had some serious heft to the the camera with the batteries, but the speed was unbelievable!  It actually worked as specified.  Again:  Wow.  It really made my D300 much sturdier.  I shot in the paddocks during the early morning hours before the crowds;  It was slightly overcast and many of the automobiles where under tents in even more shade.  This battery grip, with the 8 AA's, + the D300 battery in the camera, and my hefty 17-55 F2.8 lens made for one heavy, yet sturdy package.  Many images where shot around 1/10th, 1/15th second handheld with NO problems at all.  As the weather cleared up and the cars hit the track I did not miss a single  moment of the action!  I switched from the 17-55 to the 18-200VR and went on a shooting spree!  I came home with 2004 images.  Of which I weeded them down to just over 200.  I went trigger happy as I was so amazed at the shooting speed.  Again: Wow. I love this thing!I can't state it often enough:  If you were planning on getting one, don't hesitate.  Get one!  I will be upgrading soon to a D700 and this grip will work on it but most likely I'll order another one so I can keep this on on the D300.An outstanding product.  You won't be disappointed.  [...]UPDATED 2/23/2009:  This product is freakin' amazing.  I just received word from Amazon that my new D700 is being delivered this morning.  As soon as I get home, the Zeikos is being moved from my D300 body where it has NOT COME OFF to the D700.  I am then re-ordering another one for the D300.I LOVE this thing!  It makes holding the camera for long periods of time so much more comfortable, and the speed increase if fabulous.. The summary for the 38687 is Excellent Product.  Excellent Value!

So the only reason to get a 32GB Class 2 MicroSD card is if you don't want to switch between two 16GB cards (like say, if you use it in a phone and it's not worth the pain to maintain 2 cards).If you stay at 16GB and move up classes, like to a Class 4 or Class 6, the prices are also exponentially disproportionate. Is the performance increase worth it? I couldn't really tell you because I don't have a Class 4 or 6 to compare it to.But here's the bottom line: I filled my Class 2 card with a bunch of video clips, movies, anime, CGI files, you name it, and they ALL played just as smoothly on the Nokia N900 straight from the card as from the on-board 32GB memory.So unless you have huge HD movie files that really require faster speed than the Class 2 (which is very debatable), this Class 2 card is more than fast enough, and is currently the best price/memory space/convenience combo out there.Highly recommended!.

I'm not techie enough to go and run speed tests and measure the power saving features this advertises but from my real world experience it operates at a quick enough speed when I transfer data between my PC's and NAS and my internet speed seems to be just fine.Something to note - there is quite a bit of size difference between the 5 & 8 ports switches so I'd suggest taking note of that if you're on the fence and/or you have space restrictions where you'll be placing the switch.  That's why I chose the 5 port for my second one due to the location it was going into (otherwise the more ports the merrier).You can spend more on a switch but unless you have a specific need this won't satisfy I think you'd be wasting money.

This switch idles around 2W and then with my short cabling only added less than 0.5W per port connected.The BAD:  I should have looked closer before purchasing.  The ports are on the opposite side from the lights.  This makes fault diagnosis so painful.  Also, the cables plug in with the release tab facing down on this switch.  That means I have to physically lift the hub up so that I can get my fingers to the tabs that face down to remove cables.  If you work in a dynamic environment where you plug and unplug cables regularly, or need to troubleshoot connections, this switch is not for you.  Recommendation to TRENDnet: put in the ports that have the connect and activity lights and rotate them so that the release tab is on top so it is easy to access if the switch is on a tabletop..

Due to the arrangement of devices, we have several 8 port switches connected to a larger 24 bit switch which I guess is the backbone of our LAN.When shopping for gigabit switches, the Trendnet 8 port gigabit greennet switch came up as not only a low cost, but also a low power switch. We purchased several and have been using them for almost half a year.These switches are silent (there is no fan), and very low power (on my Killowatt meter they always show 0 watts), and very fast. They have limited support for jumbo packets (I forget the exact number, but its around a jumbo packet size of 7-9K).This is a good solution as a low power, silent, gigabit switch that runs cool and is low cost.

When I pulled it out of the box I was immediately happy with build quality and materials, even design and colors.  Seeing the images on websites made me aprehensive, thinking it was cheap or crappy.  Not the case in person!  Hooking up is immediate of course.  As far as usuage, to cut things short, I now have 3 of these in my house, two of which are daisy-chained. Its been about six months, and not even a hiccup.  Everything runs consistently at blistering speeds.  If these things last a few years rather than simply dying quickly, they will certainly justify the reasonable price.  Very happy with these gigabit switches..

I was debating between this one (TRENDnet TEG-S80G), the D-Link DGS-1008G, the NETGEAR GS108NA, and the Linksys SE2008.  I needed something reliable, had the features I wanted, and was fast.  This TRENDnet satisfied all my criteria and for a cheap ~$25 bucks, I was willing to give it a shot.1. Look & Feel - The first thing you'll notice when you pick up this switch is how solid the construction feels.  This isn't some cheap plastic, I am not sure if it is aluminum, but its not a cheap metal either.  It feels similar to the NETGEAR GS108NA.  Solid body, hard metal construction.  Vents on the side of the unit help keep this switch cool, though it really doesn't need it.  But unlike NETGEAR switches, the Ethernet Port plugs are on the backside along with the unit's power plug, this is a major plus.  One thing I hated about NETGEAR switches was how their plugs were on the front, but the power plug was on the back.The link lights of the switch are fairly non-intrusive.  They aren't super blinding bright, but they are clearly visible.  If you plan on putting this switch in a place where you might sleep, don't worry, this little switch won't be keeping you up all night.  Link lights are accurate as well.  Top row of lights mean there is an active link, the bottom row is the speed at which the port is connected.  Orange for 10/100Mbit and Green for 1000Mbit/1Gigabit.I wasn't a fan of the green design that came with the unit, but it's starting to grow on me. ;)2. Heat & Power Consumption - I really hate how some routers and switches get hot.  This unit is cool to the touch and has been on for days now.  If you look through the vent holes you can clearly see that they've mounted a heat-sink on the PCB.  The power adapter is ALSO cool to the touch.  Even if I tax the switch and start transferring gigabytes of data over the network this thing never heats up to hot or even moderate warm.  At worst, it is below luke-warm.3. Features - This was by far the most important thing to me.  I have a quirky set-up in my home where I have 3-4 computers, media PCs and a NAS set up around the house.  Every single one of them is setup for Wake on Lan (WOL).  I was reading around the internet and I heard reports that all these newer switches that touted GREEN power did NOT work with Wake on LAN.  I will confirm right now that THIS TRENDnet TEG-S80G 8-Port Unmanaged Gigabit Switch WORKS PERFECTLY WITH WAKE ON LAN.  If you buy this switch specifically and it doesn't work for Wake on LAN, you are doing something wrong.  It is not the fault of the switch.  Computers that are completely shut off, still maintain an active link light with the switch.  Yes, this switch still has GREEN power features, so that is a major plus as well.4. Speed - I personally have not noticed any speed differences between this and my D-LINK DIR-655 router acting as a switch (DHCP off).  I ran some speed tests over the switch with 'LAN Speed Test (Lite)' and these are my results.Test Hardware:ASUS RT-N56U (w/ custom firmware)TRENDnet TEG-S80GCAT 5e Cable - Total Length about 25 meters between computers.* Note: I don't have jumbo frames or anything like that set up.

When I use Windows Copy, speeds start out peak at ~190MB/s but quickly dip down to 90-110MB/s.I use this switch to stream 1080p movies from the NAS and there have never been any issues with stuttering or lag.Overall, this is a fantastic switch.  I've only owned it for about a week, so only time will tell how reliable it is.

Great sound and plenty of volume. I mainly bought it because I wanted something to boost the volume on my laptop, but it seems it's going have quite a few uses for me. It makes the music on my iPhone sound great (as opposed to the tinny phone speakers), and I'm listening to Pandora on my Kindle Fire HD with it as I'm typing this.If you buy one and are not picky about color, be sure to click on each color as I found they were all different prices. I got mine (red) for $11.72 (w/free Amazon Prime 2-day shipping). The most expensive color was around $25. Amazon's shipping was great, as always. I ordered the speaker yesterday and received it today.*EDIT 1/20/13 - All of the above was true, until the unit went stone dead on me a few days ago! Nothing coming out of it but a little static. My 5-star review is now a 1-star review.**EDIT 1/22/13 - I returned the defective speaker (Amazon makes it super easy), received a replacement today. I'm upgrading review to 3 stars based on the speed and ease of replacement (turnaround was 1 day). I'll amend it again if this one stops working. :).

As an inexperienced "glass" purchaser, I was unaware of its inability to auto-focus due to the lack of a focus motor in the body of the D3100. Although pulling manual focus wasn't a "HUGE" deal, I was worried I was going to miss shots due to getting the focus wrong and decided to look elsewhere for a similar camera lens with AF-S in the lens.I was really looking for a portrait lens for indoor situations. I found the 50mm lens to be a little too close for my needs. Indoors in certain rooms, I needed to stand too far away to get the portrait I was looking for. The 35mm seemed to be a perfect focal length. I set the lens to AF-S and entered my Aperature Priority mode to adjust my F-stop down to 1.8 and took some close-ups of my 2 week old son. The depth of field was amazing, the focus was decent, and the sharpness was nothing like I'd ever seen before. It looked just like a professional portrait! It's amazing what a fast lens will do for you.If I had one complaint, it would be the speed in which this lens pulls focus. It seems a little slow... However, that could be that I'm trying to pull off too many shots in lower-light situations. Even with the flash, it seems to take a while for the camera to register and take the exposure.

The nifty-fifty on a crop-sensor is no longer 50mm. I figured the 35mm was a closer match to the age-old nifty-fifty style. Now, from what I gather (reading before and afterward) the 35mm can cause some distortion in the image because of the wide angle. The 50mm and 85mm primes are more zoomed in but cause less distortion. I have not noticed anything &#8220;shockingly obvious&#8221; as far as distortion and feel the lens is great at what primes do, mainly bokeh and low-light shots.I took our baby announcement photos with this lens and they came out beautiful and there wasn&#8217;t a large amount of daylight (winter and no windows large enough close by).I would highly recommend this lens to anyone entering into prime lenses.

I've found it to be pretty sharp wide open, but sharpest at f/2.8... still very fast. This lens is also perfect to throw on your camera for that family party, when you can't be all into your "photography".... focuses fast and gives you great shots in that low indoor light with a nice soft background.If your looking for a great general purpose fast prime, this lens is perfect. The 35mm focal length (52mm apparent) is a little better suited to the DX format than the 50mm (75mm apparent) in my opinion... works a little better indoors.Build quality is as about as good as it gets with a plastic lens. Metal construction would obviously make this lens feel more substantial, but it would also make it much heavier. This lens is light! Great walk around lens.

For me, this was my 3rd lens.  The first were the kit 18-55mm Nikon VR lens and the 55-200mm telephoto Nikon non-VR lens.  Both of those lenses are very good, and very versatile, but in terms of image quality they can't even remotely touch this one.First things first, it's a prime lens, meaning no zoom.  Kind of obvious, but should at least be mentioned for those newer to the hobby.  However, that doesn't mean that it can't take pictures from far away, on the contrary, it can take some stunning pictures from a distance, it will just be that you can't zoom in closer on things at a distance.  It's actually very good at landscapes, especially late evening sunsets and night time skylines, for instance.Additionally, this lens is so sharp, that you can crop a LOT.  Meaning that you can effectively get zoom after the fact by cropping your picture in photo editing software, and the image will still look very good, as long as you nailed your focus in the original picture (obviously the more you crop, the more you notice things being out of focus).Secondly, it doesn't have vibration reduction.  However, this is a fast lens, which negates most of the need for VR in the first place.  What photo nerds mean by a 'fast lens' that is that it lets in a lot of light, meaning that the shutter can open and close very quickly and still properly expose the image, meaning that blur, both from camera shake and moving subjects are DRASTICALLY minimized.  It also thus better at 'freezing' moving objects, that would blur in a slower lens.  The only time where VR would be a welcome addition is possibly extremely low light photography, but even then you should be fine without it.  To be honest, I'm almost glad it's not on there, because I often forget to turn VR off when I don't need it, and VR does run your battery down faster.Now that those two caveats are out of the way, on to the strengths:This will enable photos that you just can't take with the kit lens.  Especially if you're interested in concert photography (or any other form of photography that involves low light, but also movement).  In most instances, this lens just takes better looking pictures than the kit lens.  But in low light concert photography it will actually take pictures that a slower lens just can't take without extreme blur (or using the flash, which both kills the atmosphere and often times isn't allowed).  For instance, a lead singer who moves his head back and forth some on a dimly lit stage.  With the kit lens his head will just be a blur, which is sometimes a cool effect, but sometimes it just looks blurry.  With this lens, you can get a nice crisp image if you want, or adjust your aperture, or your shutter speed and get the motion blur as well, if you want it.  It's nice to have both options.The bokeh.  Bokeh is a photography term that essentially just means 'blurry background'.  This is what really makes portraits 'pop' as the subject's face can really be set apart from the background.  It's also good when you have a busy background that would otherwise be distracting, even if you're not shooting portraits.  Just go into aperture priority mode and set this baby to f1.8, get relatively close (a few feet) to your subject and fire away.  Your portraits will take on that dreamy professional look.  The closer you are to your subject, the more extreme the bokeh effect is (which is why this lens can effectively take landscape shots, because the effect is diminished greatly when you're shooting from a large distance).More control over your depth of field.  This is basically the same strength as the previous point, but just more widely considered.  With the kit lens, at any given focal length, your f/stop options are going to be pretty limited.  Meaning you're basically stuck with the depth of field you have.  However, with this lens, you basically always have from f1.8 to f22.  This gives you extreme control over how deep your field is (essentially how large the range of 'in focus' is, and how gradually images fade from in focus to out of focus).  You can create that nice blurred background we talked about above, or you can have an identifiable background as well.  This is especially useful when shooting dogs, for instance, because sometimes (like when they're in profile) you want a very shallow depth of field, to give good bokeh and sharpness, while others you want a little more depth of field (like if they're looking straight forward at you and you want to keep the tip of their nose all the way to their ears in focus.  Being able to control your depth of field is really the first step (of many) into going from a snapshot shooter with a nice camera to an actual photographer.Light weight, short length.  doesn't seem like a big deal into you lug a heavy 15-300 zoom lens around on your neck all day long.  It's also short, which is surprisingly helpful in a crowded environment, like a concert.While this lens is obviously not quite as versatile as a kit or telephoto lens, the images you get will blow you away.  Yes, you will have to move around more to get the shot you want and/or crop more.  But that's not much of a price to pay for drastically improved image quality.  Since I've bought this lens, the 18-55 mm lens rarely comes out of the bag.  I still use other lenses, but this is the default go to lens.  The one that stays attached when the camera is in my bag, so that if I need to pull it out and snap off a shot in a hurry, this is the one that will be taking it..

I settled on this one because I can always "zoom in" by cropping, but I couldn't zoom out after the fact with the 50mm!  I am pretty sure I made the right choice.  I've taken a couple hundred shots with it now.  I use it with a D5100, and they are a perfect match.This is a very low-cost lens which provides exceptional value as a general purpose and low-light lens.  It's great at night or indoors for use without flash, or for bokeh.  In full daylight or with flash and if you aren't trying for bokeh, the kit zoom is good enough.You can use this to take group photos, the kids opening their christmas presents, "tourist snapshots," or anything else you would use a general purpose lens for.  Equivalent to a 50mm lens on a film camera.  It is not a portrait lens, you either get big noses or have to crop too much.  Nor is it a wide angle lens.  You can't get a whole room in one shot with this.The best part of the lens is the very high optical quality for the price, and focus override without needing to push buttons or flip a switch.  It doesn't have any externally moving parts (even the focus ring doesn't move unless you turn it), so if you take it to a dirty environment, you'll get less crud in your camera.There are some cons to the lens, but all of them minor.  First, no image stabilization.  I haven't missed it too much since you can use faster shutter speeds with this lens, but it is a limitation.  The bokeh quality varies depending on what is in the background.  "High frequency" backgrounds, that is backgrounds with lots of almost-focused detail, produce terrible bokeh (it looks like a blurry double image - I call it "drunk double vision bokeh").  You can see this on Ken Rockwell's page and I have had the same experience.  Most of the time it looks great.  But taking a close picture of a curly-haired dog, I got the bad bokeh in the dog's fur.  I also find that mine focuses about an inch too close at short range (1.5-2 feet).  A tiny nudge of the focus override (or moving an inch forward if in single-focus mode) fixes this, fortunately, and no problems at longer ranges.  It probably still focuses a little close, but DOF is enough for it not to matter, even wide open.  It's not a macro lens anyway.  Finally, the focus ring feels a little flimsy, not like it's going to fall apart, just kind of ... loose.  It's not inaccurate, looseness is only in the feel.  I guess that is a tradeoff for the instant focus override at this price point.Purchased from local store, not Amazon, since I needed it immediately.I am taking off one star for the inaccurate focus, even though I can live with it.  Otherwise, I'd give it five.  It really is a very good lens - I use this for everything medium-range and only use the kit lens for wide-angle and macro shots now..

The autofocus is easily overriden with a quick twist of the focal ring when you want to manually control your shot.I got this lens because I wanted to use it in indoor and low light settings with my D5000.  The results in these situations have actually surpassed my expectations.  The lens is fast enough to produce sharp, properly exposed photos indoors at night with no flash.  With the flash (I have an SB-600) the images are fantastic and look like natural light.  The lens is diverse enough that you can take a sharp group shot, or a close up of a single item with great bokeh.  I find myself using it a lot more than I expected and in all types of settings.If you're like me and this is your first prime lens, it does take time to get used to not being able to zoom.

I see a lot of prosumers complaining about gear that I love in amazon.com reviews. I am always surprised about what brings those reviewers to what clearly is a BUDGET item.If you look at all those professional photos taken in magazines. Mainly for portraits. Even those product images in blogs like Engadget you notice that they have a shallow depth of field (DOF). Basically shallow DOF is the cool things in photography. Some Point and Shoot cameras are even trying to emulate it by the built in software. I have a Nikon D90 that came with the stock 18-105mm lens and I bought an 80-300mm lens. Now the tele-zoom lens does give you shallow DOF if you are taking a picture of a small object and have enough distance to stand really back with a large tripod to stabilize the whole rig and take a photos. But that will never work if you are trying to take a portrait.This is a $200 F1.8 35mm D format prime lens. So I do believe it is not what the professionals use. But I am not a professional. All what I want is to take really good pictures for my family. That's all what I wanted since I picked up photography as a serious hobby almost 2 years ago ( I am in my mid 30s). I can say this lens have given me my best portraits! I find myself printing and framing more of those portraits and so does my wife and that is more than enough for me.So let us talk about the lens itself; It is a fixed focal length lens so basically you have to move around quite a bit to get your photo in frame. It also does not have image stabilization built in. While lacking IS is an issue in low light if you are taking pictures for static objects I use this lens mostly for moving subjects which mean in low light I have to depend on high ISO rather than a stable lens as my subjects are moving. IS won't help reduce the blur of a moving subject. Focus is fast enough. The DOF is where this camera excels.If you are on a limited budget and always wanted that cool optical shallow (DOF). Not the one that you can get with photoshop then you'll like this lens. If you are a pro then what the heck are you doing looking at a lens that is priced below $1000!!!!!.

The reason why is uncontrolled achromatism or CA in the form of purple fringing.  It's most prevalent at f1.8 and can be somewhat tamed stopping down.  This lens is sharp wide open, so it's a shame to get hefty amounts of CA under certain lighting conditions and contrasty situations.  My D7000 does not automatically correct for axial CA that plagues this lens, and it can also be rather hard to fix in post, if at all.  I would recommend shooting at 1.8 only when needed in (very) low light/contrast situations...not daylight of course.  The original review below still applies, except I may now be a bit hesitant to recommend this lens.Original review: This is a great lens, sharp, inexpensive, light, easy to carry, and perfect for "snapshots".  It can be a no-brainer purchase as so many others have said.However, in my opinion, it's a 200 dollar "snapshot" lens.  That's not a bad thing either.  It's an easy lens to tote around for crystal clear "general" pics.  The problem I have is not necessarily a fault with the lens, but rather it's ability to make me less creative.  Therefore, I don't consider it a "no-brainer" purchase.  I'm not rich and have to think about what else I could use my 200 dollars towards.  I have a 16-85vr for general picture taking.  My other two lenses, 10-24 and 70-300vr, are the two most creative lenses I own and I find I run to those before mounting the 35.  That's just me and maybe it's something for you to think about too.  Is this lens going to give you generally clear "snapshot" pics or is is going to offer you unique ultra-wide or telephoto views?  If you want no-worries clear pics, then I'd say go for it.Distortion:  The first portrait I took with the 35 surprised me as my subject's nose was larger than life.  It wasn't "huge", but noticeable.  I was maybe about 3 feet away, which I thought to be an okay standoff distance from a person.  True, the lens has barrel distortion to be aware of.  Allowing for more distance from the lens to subject will minimize barrel distortion when taking portraits.  The distortion caught me off guard, but I'm aware of it now and able to easily compensate for it.  The 50 f/1.8D doesn't have distortion, so it may be worth considering for a DX portrait lens as well.Light: Here's what's great about the 35:  It's 35mm and DOF is less restrictive shooting a f/1.8 as opposed to say shooting the 50/85 at f/1.8.  At 50/85mm f/1.8, the DOF is very shallow and it's possible to focus on a persons eyes and have their ears and nose out of focus.  Shooting wider at 35mm f/1.8 broadens your DOF and you're more assured of getting your subjects entire face/head in focus.  This is one reason I'd keep the 35mm, or even shoot with a 24mm f/2.8.  You can routinely shoot at f/1.8 in low light and at slightly slower shutter speeds than the (telephoto) 50/85.  To me, this is the most important benefit of shooting fast, wide-angle lenses.Alternatives to the 35: I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the 50 as well, whether the 50 1.8D or 50 1.8G.  The 50 1.8D is a cheaper lens alternative with no distortion and longer reach for portraits.  The 50 1.8G has minor distortion as well, though similar build and look of the 35.  Do forget the more expensive 35 f/2D, which you'd be able to use on an FX camera when you upgrade.  Regarding the 50mm focal length, I've never had a problem shooting all sorts of indoors portraits with my 50.In the end, I can recommend the 35 without hesitation.  However, if you have other lenses to buy, such as a wide angle or super telephoto, you might consider saving the 200 dollars towards one of those.  I'd also ask myself if shooting a 35mm prime will have me snapping stagnate images or creative & unique photos.Good luck with and enjoy the 35!. The summary for the 38927 is Wonderful little lens!

If grabs focus relatively quickly and can track it well with the SWM focusing motors inside. Images are sharp and no real fine tuning is necessary. If you increase the sharpness in Photoshop after shooting with this, it's merely gratuitous.Quiet. Not that this is a big deal, but, in some situations, it may end up being a deal. Weddings for example: shooting during the ceremony demands the utmost in stealth.Light. You'll barely know you're carrying it if it's not on the body. When it is on the body, it adds little weight.Cons:Manual focusing ring feels a bit cheap and disconnected at times. It does the job well and there's no functionality problems, just feels kinda cheap.Overall, a great lens with little to no real issues that would prevent any DX shooter from owning it.

That being said, this normal DX-format lens delivers surprisingly good results in a very affordable package.My very first Nikon SLR was a used Nikkormat FTn, bought when I was a college student. It came with a Nikkor 28mm f/2.8 lens, and I started immediately adding new Nikkor lenses, such as the classic 105mm f/2.5 lens, a 35mm f/2.0, a 24mm f/2.8 and others, but it took a couple of years for me to pick up a "normal" lens, a used Nikkor-S 50mm, f/1.4 lens. This was purchased at a Saturday yard sale, and from the first moment that I saw the results, I wondered why it had taken me so long.  It was sharp when stopped down to about F/2.0, and it was perfect for lower light situations.I am a proponent of normal lenses, even though Nikon and others have been pushing the concept of using basic zooms as "kit lenses" for the last few years. I have no complaints about the overall versatility of my18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens, which came standard with one of my cameras. But this new 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Nikkor lens really shines when it comes to sharpness and low-light capabilities... enough so that it's the one that stays on my camera most of the time.Pros:* Extremely affordable Nikkor prime lens for Nikon AF-S cameras* Perfect for low-light conditions, travel, & general photography* Uses familiar 52mm filters that Nikon has used for so many lenses* HB-46 bayonet lens hood comes standard* Excellent edge-to-edge sharpness* Very good bokeh for selective focus* Great colorCons:* Some color fringing and chromatic aberration when wide open at f/1.8* A bit of barrel distortionFirst Impressions:Made some notes when I first received this lens some month back.  It came boxed in typical Nikon fashion, and when opened one finds that the lens has a lightweight but solid feel.  The construction is largely plastic, but has a metal mount.  It's also nicely balanced to the rear, to the lens mount itself.  The lens focuses internally by moving only the rear elements, and the filter mount and front elements don't move at all.  It comes packaged with the following:* HB-46 Bayonet Lens Hood* LC-52 Snap-On Front Lens Cap* LF-1 Rear Lens Cap* CL-0913 Soft CaseIn Use:One of the first things that I noticed was just how well balanced this lens felt.  It's lightweight, but with the bulk of its weight toward the lens mount, the feel was quite good.  The focus switch on the lens barrel has two choices: M/A (manual/automatic) or M (manual).  Found that if left in the M/A position it worked just fine either way.  The HB-46 lens hood goes on easily in bayonet fashion, and can be reversed easily when it's time to put the camera away.  Fortunately this lens uses the `standardized' Nikon s 52mm filters, helpful if you already have an investment in them.  The filter ring is stationary; it doesn't rotate, and there was no vignetting problem with two filters stacked, such as the UV and a polarizer.The low-light performance of this lens is good, though at f/1.8 there is a bit of softness, which is to be expected.  At f/2.0 there's not much difference, but at f/2.8 the image is obviously improved, with increased sharpness and contrast, and the details are more defined in the corners.  At f/4.0 there is more sharpness, and at f/5.6, there is a slight lessening of contrast, but the corner details are slightly better.  At f/8.0, the quality is still quite good, and the depth of field is excellent, but there's a decline into some diffraction, with a bit of lower contrast and somewhat reduced sharpness and contrast.  Have learned that when shooting in aperture priority mode, it's best to leave it at a default between f/4 and f/5.6, and go from there.This Nikkor lens does produce beautiful colors and contrast, and it focuses extremely fast even under low light conditions.  Its 7-blade rounded diaphragm helps to produces a nice bokeh effect.  And the close focusing goes down to about twelve inches, so you can get very creative without having to fiddle around.Additional Thoughts:Just because this lens is so reasonably priced is no reason to put a cheap and possibly inferior filter on it.  I fortunately have a small supply of the older Nikon 52mm L37C UV haze filters that have been in use for years, but theNikon 52mm Screw-on NC Filteris its multi-coated replacement.  It's a protective filter that also reduces glare for outdoor shooting.  If you explore here, you'll find others, such as some from Hoya, Sigma and others.  It's a subjective choice, but be sure to get a good one.If you're looking for a specialized portrait lens, forget this one.  The50mm f/1.8G AF-S Nikkor Lenslens has a field of view of a 75mm on DX-series bodies, and it has a fast maximum aperture.  It's excellent in low lighting situations and great for producing images with beautiful bokeh.  The85mm f/1.8G AF-S Nikkor Lensis more costly, but when mounted on a DX-format DSLR, it has an effective field of view of 127mm.Summary:If you own a DX-format Nikon DSLR this lens is a great choice.  It's compact, very lightweight, balances beautifully on your body, and is a true joy to use.  It's an excellent complement to any zoom, and one that most will find being used in preference for general shooting, along with being a perfect choice for low-light situations.  It doesn't take long to appreciate the way you can handle your camera in comparison with heavier, longer zooms.  This Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX lens is quite affordable and a surprisingly good value, and is highly recommended as a 5-star choice.5/16/2012.

Finally realizing that most of what I was interested in watching consisted of local channels - I decided to break my long-term relationship with the Satellite providers, and save $60+ per month by taking advantage of FREE, over-the-air television signals. After all - twenty to twenty-five minutes of every prim time hour are filled with commercials anyway.However, This presented a new problem for me. See - I live in Jacksonville NC (home of Camp Lejeune USMC base). I live within a couple miles of the base which means that any broadcast signals are subjected to the plethera of radio frequencies and satelite signals generated daily by the base's standard operations.Combine that with the fact that "local" TV channels are EXTREMLY limited in this area.At first - I ran out to a local retail super discount store and picked up a couple models which they were selling in their limited inventory. This did not work well because their offerings were substandard in quality.Then I began browsing the web for advice, (this should have been my first choice). I returned the under-performing antennas to the super center, and ordered a model which I found to be pretty highly recomended on Amazon.Upon receiving that RCA ANT751 - I opened the box and began the very SIMPLE assembly required on this un-assuming antenna.When most of us think outdoor tv antennas, we likely think of the huge, ugly, monstrocities which once dotted the landscape of rural America. This model, however; breaks that stereotype with it's rather compact size, and ease of installation.Once installed and positioned, I connected the coaxial cable to the TV, and scanned for channels. I was shocked to find that I could receive 23 channels. This even exceeded the results given by the well-known antenna advisory website. They predicted I could get about eight locals with a "large" outdoor antenna.With some fine-tuning - I was in business. I was now getting free, over-the-air, un-compressed digital television without an overly-intrusive antenna messing up the landscape.Let me say at this point that results WILL vary depending upon landscape, weather conditions, direction, location, and aiming. But for my area - this antenna is VERY impressive. It is deffinately worth your consideration.It should also be noted that I have a clear area in my yard that is not obstructed by trees or tall buildings..

Most of these stations are in the UHF band. It simultaneously receives signals from the opposite direction (where the gain is much lower) at distances exceeding 20 miles - most of those being in the VHF band. Yes, as others have pointed out, it does feel somewhat light and perhaps fragile; the low weight undoubtedly due to the fact that it's constructed mostly from aluminum. For reference, I live in Morgan Hill, CA and receive many stations from as far away as San Francisco (to the northwest), Salinas (south) and Monterrey (west southwest) - well over 70 stations!I got very poor reception mounting it in the attic because the entire roof deck is covered with metal foil to minimize the temperature in the attic.

See my review of: "LAVA HDTV Digital Outdoor Antenna with Remote Control HD-2605".  That experience had begun to give me the impression that broadcast TV signals were just so unreliable that the experience was going to be mediocre at best.  Using my broadcast DVR was going to be impossible.This RCA product completely turned that all around.  I took this to the same location in my attic, hung the angled pole from my rafters, using the supplied mounting bracket (much better than a straight vertical pole).  Connected the antennae to the pole, attached the existing house wiring and then made a crude rotation to the approximate direction recommended on antennaweb.org.  DONE!!!  Once I rescanned, all my primary channels were "locked in" good.  Less than an hour from box to watching my favorite shows in full HD!  Been about 3 months now and I almost never see de-pixelization, even then it looks more like a broadcaster issue, not the antennae.  I also got several channels we could not even see with other antennas and a couple really distant ones we did not know existed.  I just can't get over the difference....the picture is rock solid and I have never even fine tuned the rotation of the antennae.  Even stations whose towers are in opposite directions get a pretty good picture without moving the antennae.This product had no real Cons I could identify.  It is easy to install, requires virtually no adjustment for a high quality, stable picture.  The quality of the construction is very good.  The picture stability makes it so you can use a DVR without worrying whether an antennae adjustment will be needed to record your show.PS:  Another  reviewer recommended a signal amplifier and I would recommend it as well.  Especially if the antennae is more than 20 feet from your TV or you are splitting the signal among more than one device.  I cannot say I have actually tried a with and without test of the signal amp, but I see multiple sources that recommend their use in stabilizing the signal.  I am using the "Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 Bi-Directional RF Amplifier" and have been pleased with it.  I really think it makes a difference in being able to get channels in the opposite direction as my primaries, without rotating the antennae.Also, now that I have a stable picture, I am really loving my DVR: MAGNAVOX MDR513H/F7 HDD and DVD Recorder with Digital Tuner.  I'd have a few suggestions on things they could improve on the next model, but overall I'd rate it a 4 out of 5.  I'll try to write a more comprehensive review of that as time permits..

I live about 40 air-miles from the TV towers in the city (thankfully all the TV stations are in the same area), and it pulls all HD stations in with better than 90% signal - according to my TV.  The remaining low-power TV stations that still broadcast analog are fuzzy and weak, but that is not the antenna's fault.  Low power TV stations usually run 1%-5% the power of standard TV stations, and you need a LOT of antenna to get those clearly unless you are close by.I have my antenna on the apex of the roof of a single story house and use RG-6 cable down to the TV.  Installation was very easy with the included mount - which is exactly the same as a Dish Network satellite dish mount.  Very handy!The only problem you might have with a Yagi/directional antenna like this is if the TV stations in your city are in different areas.  This antenna needs to be aimed towards the TV towers for best signal.  If the TV towers are in opposite directions (not usual but certainly possible) you may need two of these and a combiner - that can get complicated.  But otherwise for the price, this is a really decent, small antenna that would easily fit in your attic.  Very happy with this purchase!.

Their rates for pay local, pay everything else. Just way too much. After getting this one in December of 2011. I had only mounted it in my Utility Room. I only got 40 DTV channels from it. A few days ago I had mounted it on the side rear of the house and got additional 20 more DTV channels. WoW! I am just using the mask mount that this one comes with. Nothing more. Also using the RCA TVPRAMP1R Outdoor Antenna Pre-amplifier into Leviton 47690-6 1x6 Passive TV/CATV Splitter Module all sold on Amazon. After getting the Termination Tool for the CableTV box so I can use the 5x lines from them that I had paid for them to redo my house on my own system. This Friday was the big day! Everything worked. No issues what so ever! Couldn't be more than happy. HDTV comes in so clear/sharp on my 6x HDTV. Got one in every ROOM and the Outdoor Patio. But funny I am able to pick-up one or two Analog Channels along with the DTV. Takes a while for these new sets to tune and lock into the DTV. Some sets like the Element Electronic HDTV give you a DTV Guide like you get with Cabletv Box. SONY and VIZIO doesn't do that. Some tell you how well the signal is. Lots of info there from the DTV. Since now it combines both VHF/UHF into one.Installing the HDTV ANT it's based you use wood base, sure you could connect this to your side of your masonry block too. I didn't want to do that. There is a free web site called antennapoint you just enter your zip code and it will tell you what DTV station is nearby. Range by degree and miles. Station ID and more. Pretty good because might RCA HDTV ANT is tilted to the left an aimed in line of sight between a tree and house roof. But I have stations behind me also. My range is around 40 miles than with the Pre-amp say another 10 miles. So now it's 50 miles radius. Good enough for me! I get stations not even Comcast Cable TV has. Which is good in a way. And wait it's not just the reception but the audio is either 5.1 or 7.1 depending on the station. Clear no static no drops like you would get with your cable company.I do recommend getting the RCA Pre-Amp for this one also 6-gauge wire connected to coax grounding block that should be near your electric box. So you can prevent damaged from lightning strikes. You don't want that. All you need is available from Amazon.Also get yourself a weather enclosure box so you can store all your coax, pre-amp and spliters into. Just like the CableTV company does. Or you can use silicone plumper tape that keeps the connections dry in the rain.Again do-it-yourself type of HDTV ANT. Make sure you plan first and get all the coax you need for the task in hand. Best to use coax that the CableTV company not using if you also cut the cord too. Good luck and enjoy your free DTV that you control and not the Cable companies!.

I haven't had this RCA ANT751 antenna long but so far all of my channels come in flawlessly, including NBC. I am no AV expert but this small antenna must have some kind of mathematical precision in its construction to outperform such a large antenna.I just had a lot of trouble getting over the nonsense in my head that kept saying that "bigger antennas are better". The antenna it replaced looked intimidating- almost like an angry Sputnik with 3x the spikes and bristles crashed on my roof. This new RCA antenna looks unimpressive- like a toy with simple set of silver folding twigs, but it stomped all over the big Sputnik antenna in performance.So far this antenna gets my highest recommendation.

Not so difficult on an exterior installation, but I wanted to avoid the community association approval process and the more expensive and challenging grounding activities around an external installation.  Aiming for the attic, I had only one place the antenna could go.  Problem was there was a foil backed foam insulation and a solid brick wall that the signal would have to punch through.  My expectations were not high.I received the antenna and before walking up to the attic, I thought I would test the signal through the same brick wall on ground level.  To my surprise I was able to receive the majority of the local signals in the 80-90% range even with the antenna only two feet off of the ground!  I brought it up to attic, did the install and without even fine tuning the direction I was receiving 100% on all prime networks including PBS which is one of the HD's on VHF in the local area!  Only one station (ABC) was coming in under 100% and it was at 98-99%.  Astounding performance for such a small antenna.  Great value considering it has the mounting mast as well.Highly recommended..

What most don't realize is that OTA signals brought in on an antenna are actually full HD, cable is compressed.  The resolution clarity is stunningly better with the antenna.Anyway, this is a directional antenna.  You have to point it directly towards the transmission tower(s).  If your tv transmission towers are not within several compass degrees of each other, this antenna alone will not pull all the signals/stations you may want.  If that's the case, you'll need a rotor and/or and additional antenna with a combiner that minimizes the signal cancellations (aka reflections).  multiple antennas on the same line don't work well and the more you add, the more reflection you cause.  So be careful.  This is a good antenna, but you need to research your application before purchasing.Shipping was typical Amazon, prompt and no issues.  Antenna was undamaged and all is good in my household..

I have 7 HDTVs and one HD HomeRun tuner feeding off the antenna signal using a PCT VC-9P power amp. The first antenna was a large RCA unit (a 15 ft beast that nearly killed me while I was installing it on my two story roof). After the installation I was pleased with the reception. I was receiving 36 OTA channels from about 20 miles west of Atlanta. Now looking back I really had nothing to compare it too. My HOA was not as pleased with the large antenna as I was, so I replaced it with a Antenna Direct single figure 8 unit. The unit was much smaller and had a nice modern design. It maintained my 36 OTA channels. After a recent hail storm I had the need to replace my antenna. Using the same roof mount and cable I installed the RCA ANT751R. My reception jumped to 54 channels!!!. This unit is not as cool looking as the Antenna Direct unit but it's only about 1/6th the size of the first RCA unit. It has the fold-out design like the old time antennas but is only about a yard stick long. It is very light weight and seems to be fairly sturdy. I hope my HOA is pleased with the antenna because I am.I would recommend this unit to others..

Its just not worth it.  So I read the reviews on some digital TV antennas after buying a new flat screen Samsung TV.  The reviews on this one was great so I gave it a shot.  Put it up on the roof and ran a new 100ft coax cable myself through the crawl space, dropped it down in the right place to the back of the TV.  Then you must do "auto detect channels" so the TV goes through and finds the ones that work.  Then WALA!  I had 38 crystal clear stations.  All the major network channels as crisp and clear as any cable TV.  We save the cost of this $50 thing every month and about $1000+ a year!One tip is you must go to [...] and put in your full address in the search bar.  Then zoom in on your home as close as you can go.  Then CLICK on the various networks on the left and see the direction from your house to the antennas.

So, I've gone from paying $78.55/month for internet and basic cable to paying $34/month for internet and $0 for over-the-air TV. Before trying this antenna, I tried 2 others from local stores. They were terrible. I returned them and purchased this one after reading the reviews. I live in Santa Fe, NM and the closest stations are in Albuquerque, which is about 50 miles away. I assembled the antenna (in less than 10 minutes), took it up to my roof, unplugged Com**st's cable and plugged in the antenna. I pointed it toward Albuquerque and just sat it down on my roof while I went downstairs to see if any channels came in. Immediately, my HDTV found 14 channels, all crystal-clear. Later, I simply attached the antenna to an old satellite dish that was left mounted on my roof when I bought the house. I picked up even more stations.

I had a nice quiet system until I put this thing in. Now I can hear it running from my hallway. It also did not come with the grill that covers the fan. So you are basically just getting a fan (the connection to the motherboard is there). That being said if this company put out a quieter model of this fan that looked just as cool and did the job I would definitely buy it and replace this, but for now I will just stick with this. (4 stars)Update:I was all ready to resign myself to my fate, and keep this fan. As a matter of fact I didn't even mention in my last review that it made a rattling noise sometimes when I started my PC. But it did that noise one too many times.The loudness of it made me search Amazon one last time for a new fan. I found theAeroCool Shark 120mm Blue Edition Cooling Fan EN55420for 17.99, and while it was a lot more expensive it cooled a lot better than the Cooler Master, and had more blades (15).  It was also a lot quieter even on the highest setting.All in all this is a much, much better fan, it returned the quietness of my PC and that was well worth it. Especially with 3 hard drives (2 1Tb and 1 320GB) to think of. This fan also came with fan speed cable as well as the attachment that allowed it to be connected directly to my PC Power Supply which I liked.As for the Cooler Master I would say that you get what you pay for, and if you get tired of this loud, obnoxious fan you are going to end up forgetting the 8 bucks that you paid for it and going with something better. So Im recommending the Shark in lieu of this fan and lowering the amount of stars that I gave it. (1 star).

I do not know how they measure this, because this fan is significantly louder. I am willing to partially excuse this since this fan does move significantly more air (and spins at 2000 vs. 1200 RPM). Also, this observation is while the fans are running outside the case by themselves, so it is not just the air flow through the case causing the noise. My computer is in my bedroom so I am more sensitive to noise levels, but I would still not call this fan &#34;quiet&#34; and certainly far from &#34;silent.&#34; If you want a quieter fan at the expense of airflow and LEDs, look for the cheaper CM fans.The blue LEDs themselves are certainly bright, but the way they illuminate the fan is fairly subdued. From inside my case they aren't excessively bright.Overall I am disappointed at how loud the fan is, but am impressed by the airflow. The fan is fairly quiet at 1400 RPM, so I have it hooked up to my motherboard to throttle with CPU temperature. This keeps it fairly quiet while still delivering good airflow..

I have four of them in my case, all running at 2000 rpm, and it is still a relatively quiet machine. There is no high pitched whine or any sort of mechanical noise, just some extra noise from turbulence.

It cooled well, but was far from quiet. I'm using in a home theater PC, and cannot afford to have a noisy fan. This was just plain loud, and could compete with my central AC for noise.My motherboard uses a heat sync and fanless design to cool the CPU. The case is fanless too, except for the power supply. Either one of those ideas might have been fine, but I'm using a micro ATX motherboard with its own external power supply, which left me with no fans.My inside temperatures for CPU and motherboard were 50 and 70 degrees C respectively. When I put this fan in, they dropped to 37 and 34. When I opened the case, everything felt as if the computer had been off all day. The problem was the noise.My motherboard has three fan headers. With two of them, the fan ran loud. With the CPU fan header, which was fortunately not in use, the BIOS can be set to allow me to control the fan speed with software. When I use the "silent" setting, the noise becomes tolerable.The fan is rated at 2000 RPM and at that speed, I found it uncomfortably loud. At 1800 or above, I would not recommend it. At 1600 RPM, the fan is noticeable but should not be a show stopper for a typical PC. The silent setting of my MB software seems to be keeping the speed under 1400 RPM, and the temperatures are staying as low as they were with the fan on high. I have a micro ATX motherboard in a small case, so that's not surprising.If your computer gives you the ability to control the fan speed, there's nothing wrong with this fan unless you are going out of your way to get one of the quietest fans. If you don't have that sort of speed control, fans are cheap enough that even one twice the price is not likely to bankrupt you.I found that the Antec Tri-cool fans are quieter at the lowest speed than this one at the speed my computer uses. That Antec series has the advantage of three way switches, giving you lots of manual control. The disadvantage is that if the fan header is not controlling the speed, you need to open the case to set a switch. Then again, for a typical user, it's a one time setting.Another option is theAntec True Quiet Fanit will be whisper quiet, and you may pay double, but it will still be affordable. That's fine for small cabinets like mine with modest fan requirements, but if you need large air flow or have a bigger cabinet, you might want to stick with something like the Cooler Master, especially if you can control the speed with software..

They are about the same as any other fan at full speed, maybe slightly quieter.They have a nice strong case and can keep their shape when side clamps are used instead of screws.The reason why this got 4 stars is because at low speed these things are pretty loud, they give off a hum or buzz that carries pretty far. I have a liquid cooled system so I only need my case fans to move the air in the case, not to cool. So I actually need to set these higher than they need to be in order to keep them quiet..

So I was favorably disposed to the SoundSticks even before appreciating their unique, crystalline appearance (they've become objets d'art in the Museum of Modern Art). I rather quickly went through 2 generations of SoundSticks.  They served me well, for the first year, but then I would begin having problems with a speaker shorting in and out and no possibility of repair (the SoundSticks have no user-, or for that matter, technician-accessible parts). Each of the first two SoundStick units were available from Amazon for around a hundred per pair.  But now that SoundSticks III are approaching two hundred, it's become difficult to renew a long-time attachment to the JBL-Harman line (though my Harman-Kardon receiver is still going strong).Clearly, it was time to look at the new kid on the block, the Cyber-Acoustics 3602, the most popular 3:1 system on Amazon and, at an bargain price that's likely to go up before it goes down. Moreover, in a blindfold test the sound of the CA speakers is comparable with that of the SoundSticks.  Initially the bass of the CA unit seemed excessive if not overwhelming (from a woofer made of real wood--what will they think of next?).  Then I noticed the handy bass-volume control on the included little "pod."  It wasn't until cutting back the woofer by 2/3rds that the stunning clarity of the satellite speakers emerged.  The sound may not be as "flattering" to the musician-performers as the somewhat "enhanced" audio from the SoundSticks (each with 4 JBL speakers), but what I'm hearing strikes me as more accurate, revealing, natural.  The main points:Appearance:The SoundSticks have the "Wow" factor, but even the spare HK instructions suggest that you put them under your desk, out of sight, so it's not as though the 3 pieces are all that evident to your friends (unless you have a MOMA-like little theater in your man-cave).  The 2 SoundSticks are considerably heavier, because of the the lead base (not bass), and they're an inch or two taller to accommodate the extra speakers.  Still, the CyberAcoustics satellites are solid enough to stay in place, and their sound is more accurate if slightly less enhanced.  The two speakers in each of the CA satellites are exposed, so the user must be careful not to stick a finger or thumb through one of them. Also they're ported at the top.  The SoundSticks, on the other hand, enclose the 4 speakers completely inside each column, out of harm's way, with a port at the bottom rather than the top.Sound:Again, the 3-piece SoundSticks sound different (slightly more spacious, rich and full) but not necessarily better.  Both CA and HK units have sub-woofers capable of drowning out the mids and highs of the satellite speakers not to mention bombing the user-listener into senselessness.  With the SoundSticks you have to get down on the floor to change the volume setting of the subwoofer (which is rarely necessary); with the Cyber Acoustics the volume setting of the subwoofer is on a remote control--a little puck that sits right on your desk, within easy reach. In short, both units have bass to spare.Flexibility:Here's where the Cyber Acoustics 3602 really stand-out, your quintessential "A" student.  Because of that little puck you can turn the speakers on and off and control woofer balance as well as general volume right from your desktop.  With the SoundSticks you have to get down on the floor to turn the system on and off or to adjust the output from the sub-woofer.  The general volume control is a gimmicky (but not all that convenient) "touch" surface area of the right satellite.  Finally, whereas the SoundSticks have no inputs (like the CA 3606 they have a stereo 3.5 mini-plug going out to your computer or output source), the CA 3606 has two "extra" inputs on its multi-talented little puck.  So you can plug in headphones without rearranging the back of your computer AND you can plug in an auxiliary player or tuner without undoing the primary connection (to a computer in most cases).  Finally, the CA people have thoughtfully included an iPod stand (put it next to your puck, and insert it via an enclosed shorty cord) as well as instructions more complete than those with the SoundSticks.Practicality and durability:Too soon for a reliable report. but I've had problems after the first year with both SoundSticks I and SoundSticks II--small wiring problems leading to shorting out (it's hard not to occasionally kick the sub that's under your desk or nudge the satellites placed in the confusion of a typical desk top).  Eventually a "small" problem like the shorting out of a single satellite becomes major and a fix proves impractical or cost-prohibitive.  The sub-woofers of the two systems are comparable in size and weight, and both accept a plug with tiny pins that the user must be careful not to bend out of alignment.  Frankly, the CA plug looks more user-accessible and, assuming company support is responsive, it would be a small matter to solder a new plug to replace one with bent pins.In conclusion, this particular 3-piece Cyber Acoustics unit is inarguably the best value in computer speakers. It's a fraction of the price of the SoundSticks II yet equal to the latter in audio quality (imo) and superior in terms of adaptability.  Logistics offers speakers in this price range, but not competitive in terms of quality (the top-seller ones going for ten are inferior to the onboard speakers in my iMac).  This, my 2nd Cyber Acoustics product, has exceeded expectations.  And if it breaks down after a year, I certainly won't feel I didn't get my money's worth. By then, I'm likely to concede that the subwoofer is taking up excessive space under my desk and is really not needed. (Witness what a small Tivoli or Bose speaker can do without one.  At that time, I'd look seriously at the JBL Duet speakers (a 2-piece unit that's about ten dollars less than this one)..

These work great for that.  When turned up they are plenty loud for me and the people around me but I don't think it could ever bring the neighbors knocking.  I do wish the base could be turned up even more; Dubstep type music doesn't really have the base it needs with this.The little control hub is a nice feature since they made the cords long enough it can almost reach my bed from its usual position on my desk so I can still control the volume without having to get up all the time.  The headphone jack on it is really convenient too except that I don't really understand how it regulates the volume... I can have it at a good level and then when I plug the headphones in its barely audible.  I have to turn it ALL the way up before it's at a normal volume and it seems like it goes from nothing to everything at one point when turning the volume up.  The same issue is there without the earphones in that its extremely touchy to get the volume just right.  I'm talking about turning the volume wheel MILLIMETERS and it'll be too high and then too low.Summary:For a $40 system I'm not going to complain about the little things much.

The remote puck audio controller thing is a nice feature and also adds to the coolness of the set. the volume is the entire top of the puck and rotates around the blue lighted button in the top/center. the company gives you a 6 inch 3.5mm patch cord to hook up external devices to your speakers along with a semi cheesy iPod/smart phone cradle. the system automatically shuts down one input (the pc jack) and switches to whatever you just plugged in and then switches back when you unplug it again. the bass is fine  of course its not GREAT but its only a 5 inch woofer.  >> upon first listen mine had crackly static like noise behind the audio from my pc much like what another reviewer described. being an electrical guru i knew what to try first and IT WORKED!! so if you order these and the audio is scratchy try going to your nearest auto parts store and asking for a single use tube of dielectric grease, or order some from amazon. dielectric grease restores or increases electrical conductivity between corroded or cheap metals.  i applied it to EVERY connection in this audio system and these are now the best $30 speakers i have ever owned.

Also, the accessible base/gain knob on the master volume control is a nice feature instead of having to adjust it at the woofer like my previous setup and others I've seen. I'm not sure though that this is a huge benefit however since most of the time, you set it and forget it.CONS: As the title states, the sub is a bit lacking. I'm disappointed that the manufacturer didn't disclose the frequency response on any of the speakers... yes, even the "datasheet" on their site neglects to include that info. The sub is really strong in the mids but provides next to nothing down low or even higher frequencies. Even the mid bass is more of a thump/pop rather than a smooth note. I've been playing with the bass gain knob way too much and it seems that the output varies quite a bit from song to song to where I find myself adjusting it again.I'm really surprised this system has received the high reviews that it has.

I have found something that I am not sure if its just my product or everyones but I have this plugged into a powerstrip next to my computer and if there is anything else plugged into the powerstrip then the speakers bass starts coil whinning. Its like turning your speakers all the way up and you hear that annoying like hum. I found that if you turn the sound all the way down or bass all the way down it stops this but you have to do it every single time you stop playing music or something. I am not going to return it based off of this because I like the set and I can generally just turn the set off when I am not using it to save power anyway.Another thing that I have found is that the speakers bass the further away from the head units the better if your going to have it loud, I set the bass speaker on the floor 3' below the heads and to the right about 2 foot and can turn the bass up much higher than I could when they were close so keep the location in mind..

It's really too light to hold still while you change the volume, but there are ways around it. It also has aux in and a headphone jack as well! Bass is controlled by the puck too.Having said that, when compared to the Logitech Z-230 or the Klipsch 2.1, they sound muddy at low to mid volume. Your ears adjust to them after a while, but they are noticeable while watching movies and listening to softly spoken dialog. I wouldn't knock a star at this price point. The fact that they are not utter garbage impresses me enough. If you are upgrading from laptop speakers or monitor speakers, don't hesitate! If you want to spend a bit more money I would recommend the two I mentioned earlier.

I bought this since everyone said these speakers sound really great. I do not know what these people were comparing these "great" speakers to, but there is no bass, they sound very thin, there is an audible hiss when you put them above 25% volume, and distort if you put bass up and put them over 25% volume. I guess they sound great compared to your phone speaker, or if upgrading from a clock radio, but this is an overpriced $30 system.My recommendation, if you have the money, spend the extra $50-70 for a much better system especially if you use them every day. Even if a much better system only lasts 3 years, I would definitely spend $20 a year or 6 cents a day not to have to think how crappy my speakers were 5x a day, 5x a week at work.If you do not have the extra money, buy a better system for $60 or buy something on sale for $15-30 it'll sound just as good, if not better.Update: purchased the Klipsch ProMedia and am more than satisfied with it although $70 more.

The acoustic guitars were crisp and clear, the bass guitar and bass drum are now actually audible thanks to the included subwoofer, and all of that without taking up too much desk space - or wallet space!If I had anything negative to say at all about these speakers, it would be that the radial dial for the controls is pretty poorly constructed. Cheap plastic, plus the dial to control the volume level feels like it could snap off if you touch it wrong. Luckily I have keyboard volume controls, so if I ever have to touch the dial it would be just to adjust the subwoofer.PROS:- Low price (only $40 when I purchased them)- Great sound quality- Includes a control dial for adjusting the volume, subwoofer, and has inputs for AUX and headphonesCONS:- Poor construction of the control dial.

This speaker is simply bad. Here's a few issues I have:1. Sound quality & clarity is bad once you surpassed about 50% volume.2. Bass doesn't sound clean3. It doesn't sound right with music, the clarity is just not there.Overall, the speaker is better than the dirt cheap speaker such as the Logitech LS21 because the bass is slightly stronger, but for sound clarity, this is not much of a upgrade from a cheaper laptop on board speaker. I highly recommend to spend a little bit more money and get a better speaker. For about $10 more, I upgraded to the Genius 1250 instead and it definitely has stronger bass and better clarity than this. Here's the linkGenius SW-G2.1 1250 2.1 Speaker System.

This uses shoulder screws and a slide-in design. The Silversone didn&#8217;t fit there &#8211; it was just a bit too tight. That was one issue. The other is the Dell provided shoulder screws were threaded for a floppy/optical drive (a finer thread than 3.5 inch hard drives use).The issues above could be considered faults in the Dell rather than the Silverstone. It does fit well in a white box PC&#8217;s 3.5in bay. I ended up getting a 5.25 to 3.5in adapter I had on hand. It happened to have the same thread as an optical drive and matched the Dell shoulder screws.I considered using the 3.5in caddies but they were full of drives (all 4 of them!). I could have eliminated one of the drives but the drive caddy used by Dell does not work with the center alignment. I discovered this when I was installing a [[ASIN: B00G56ZNZU SABRENT 3.5-Inch to SSD / 2.5-Inch HDD Bay Drive Converter]] into a Dell Optiplex.I want to be fair - the Silverstone adapter is very well made of well finished heavy steel. The screws were just right. In many applications where outside of Dell Optiplex or Precision systems it will work just fine. But if you are looking at Dell PC's, and there are a LOT of them out there, be aware of this adapter may have some incompatibility and if you use a Dell drive caddy be prepared to cut the handle.Because it's really well made, even though I had a problem in my application I'm giving it 4 stars.I hope this helps someone make an informed purchase in a similar situation..

That should make for both good airflow and heat conduction. I have not tried 2.5" spinning drives in this bracket.Everything is well-machined. The outer screw holes are positioned just right for my gear (they match drive holes and mounting holes in mini-tower system), no sharp edges even on the screw holes, a glossy finish that looks nice and doesn't leave a metallic scent on my hands like bare metal usually does. You'll appreciate the finish if you've used cheap drive brackets / bay converters, where I've experienced sharp edges, wobbly hinged parts, poorly aligned holes, and unfinished metal.This is just a little more expensive versus simple drive brackets, but the quality seems worth it.

(I do own a set of thin ones but it wasn't necessary for this)One thing I found to be a great find is that the two SSDs, when installed to this converter, are not touching each other.  IF it did, it would've possibly had heat issues in the future, reducing the life of the drive.I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cheap viable solution to mount their SSDs to older chassis' that didn't come with a default SSD mounting mechanism..

The mac made it really easy to set up all the configurations for the video feed to get it as close to the Mac's LCD screen as possible.  I have used it many times over the past month and have had no problems with it whatsoever.  I watch some TV shows with it and also tend to have a music video viewing session with some of my friends every once in a while (much better to watch on the TV).  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive but high quality way to connect your Mac to the Tv.  Also I should note that I made my own audio cable to go from the headphone jack to the back of my audio system, as my mac is before they switched the 2010 model to include the audio through the Mini dv port..

(See other reviews)At $13 total, it's still much less than the $40 Griffin or Moshi Adapters that are reported more likely to transmit sound.If you want to shell out the $40 for a single adapter that will 'just work' then I recommend the Griffin or Moshi Adapter.If you want to save $30 and don't mind using two cables, then buy this adapter and a TOSlink/3.5" stereo cable from Monoprice in the (high) chance sound doesn't pass through for you..

I bought 1 adapter each from separate sellers. Sadly, I don't remember which sellers they were from. But I think there are other reviews around that tell you which sellers are good and which aren't. One of the adapters I got didn't work at all, it didn't send a video signal OR an audio signal when connected. So be wary from which seller you get it from, do your research.The other one worked PERFECTLY... BUT WAIT, let me explain something first. At first I thought it didn't send an audio signal when I connected my Macbook to my TV because it would show the display, but no audio came through. Well I thought the adapter was faulty, until I googled if Macbook Pro's Mid-2009 even supported sending audio through the minidisplay port and guess what... they DON'T. Only the more recent ones do.I tested this by connecting my brother's Macbook Pro 2011-ish model to the tv with this MiniDisplay port adapter and lo and behold there was audio & video coming out from the Mac to the TV.So some of the earlier Macbook Pro's don't send audio through the mini-display port, so look up if yours does before buying this. Even without audio, (due to my Macbook, not the product's fault) this made a great adapter and worked perfectly.I give this product 5/5 stars because it works as advertised (just be careful to make sure your device can send audio through this adapter) and the price is awesome. :DUPDATE: After enjoying this awesome, inexpensive adapter for about a year or more on my Macbook Pro mid-2009, I updated to OSX Mountain Lion 10.8.2 and it STOPPED working. It worked on Snow Leopard, worked on Mountain Lion 10.8.1, but as soon as I updated to 10.8.2 -BOOM! No more signal. After troubleshooting for hours I finally realized it was the update that caused the problem, I guess Apple added something to their update to make Mac's not work with some 3rd-party devices like this one. So I ended up connecting my brother's MOSHI minidisplay port to HDMI adapter and what-do-ya-know, it began working again. So now I'm stuck using my brother's MOSHI and sadly I can't use this awesome adapter anymore.So in conclusion: This adapter DOES NOT WORK with Mountain Lion 10.8.2. :(I still give it a 5/5 for the good times I had with it and for working great. Too bad Apple sucks with the new update making this unusable. :(.

My first complaint is battery life. After using it for about six months I get well under two days use out of it before it needs a charge. What that means is, you better remember to plug it in at the end of the day, or you will likely need to have it plugged in while you use it. The plug is not all that easy to align (not terribly difficult either), so I have to wonder how long the jack on the mouse is going to last what with the constant plugging and unplugging. I've tried new batteries, twice. Not much better and they end up the same as the original after a couple of weeks.EDIT-I've now had the mouse for about 18 months. The left-click button has failed like so many others. Battery has been replaced twice more with name brand batteries. Still only about one day of cordless use before recharging. 30 days? That is just not possible under any circumstances (maybe if you never use it for those 30 days).In short - nice design but very poor quality. This is not a premium cordless mouse. For me it has become a cheaply made corded mouse that needs repair or replacement. Make sure any positive reviews are from users with at least six months of use..

To grip it adequately, your 3rd and 4th digits must curl under the lip on the right side, kind of like you are picking up a matchbox with your thumb and little finger. The result is the back of your hand being curled unnaturally. For me that means cramping just 2 to 3 hours into my work day. BTW, my hands are not large; in fact they are rather slender; this problem would be worse for a man with large hands. It's almost perfect for my wife's smaller hands. BTW2, the Anywhere MX laptop mouse is wider and more comfortable though it is not tall enough to provide a palm rest. 2) the left and right "analog" scrolling with the vertical scrolling wheel provides no feedback on the vast majority of applications which do not support variable speed left-right scrolling. I.e. there is no click, you have to push left or right until the screen moves. Also, the left and right pressure required to achieve scrolling is relatively high thus requiring a tight grip with the thumb and 3rd-4th digits and thereby aggravating the first problem I mentioned.My only other negative comment is that the mouse is fairly light. I much preferred the beefier MX Revolution and especially the larger and heavier MX-1100; though the MX Revolution was also a bit narrow. With the MX Revolution I used double-stick foam tape to build up the right side to avoid the cramping problem. I would have done that to this mouse if that had been my only issue with it. The MX-1100 was quite wide and needed no death grip to control and move it about the desk.I wish I could suggest a better option, but if the above are not issues for you, and the other slight negatives mentioned by others (e.g., the hard to find thumb button under the forward/back button), then you will like this mouse.  Robust or not, it is above average and if you have not yet had a mouse with the free-spinning wheel option, you may enter a new era of mouse use..

But it has a set of gotchas you better know about.Mouse lasted for 6 months or so and then abruptly died (never recovered from low battery state). So please beware that this mouse should use only NiMH battery (alkaline that I have used were not recommended, but I did not know about that) and switch the mouse off before changing the battery and then switch it on. Not following this procedure probably have led to demise of my mouse. Please read Logitech FAQ item "Changing the battery in my Performance Mouse MX".While it was working it was not bad, but definitely overpriced. On PCB surfaces (cooking boards are a nice mouse pad replacement ;-) is moves very smoothly, but I suspect that it produces (at lease with the version of Setpoint 6.51 on Windows 7 that I used) strange effect: the screensaver does not activate and logging off a user sometimes takes forever. Sensor just does not switch off unless you move the mouse on "conventional" surface. But this is just my guess. I never verified it.The bottom button is a brilliant invention and is very useful (I assigned Enter to it and used it quite a bit). Only few other mice (and only from Logitech) have such a button. It does not take a lot of time to get used to, but your skills are lost if you use one mouse at work, but the other different one at home.There are a couple of other problems:1. Difficulties in clicking the wheel. You can adapt to push wheel straight down. But it does destroy the ability to use tilt. You need to de-assign those functions is you use middle click often as they will invoked randomly instead of middle click.2. Positioning of back, forward and zoom buttons are suboptimal. Actually the idea of using back and forward buttons is questionable and IMHO the only mouse where they were usable was Microsoft X4 mouse (which used vertical positioning on those two buttons). In this mouse depending on your grip only one button is usable, the other is practically useless. In the past Logitech did have an innovative solution to this problem using the wheel on the thumb side in MX Revolution which is the best solution of all. The fact that this solution was dropped is a huge disappointment.3. Battery life is too short with the supplied rechargeable battery (for me it was typically less then a week). That's why I changed to regular AA batteries which again are NOT recommended and might be a cause that my mouse went south.3. Charging cord is badly thought out and does not allow to use mouse as corded mouse (you still need a receiver). It connects under an angle, the nuance which you need to get used to. But you can  use any changer with compatible plug, for example for Blackberry or Android cellphones.4. IMHO SetPoint software is not well debugged. Functionality is adequate and it allows "per application" button assignments. But reliability is suspect. I started using this mouse in Windows XP and the latest version simply periodically crashes and since that point you have no access to additional buttons. You need to use older version of SetPoint, such as 4.8 to avoid those systematic crashes with the message:Logitech SetPoint Event Manager (UNICODE) has encountered a problem and needs to closeIn Windows 7 I encountered a strange effect of erratic behavior at the bottom of FrontPage screen. Only the last line was affected.As for minor problem: there is no compartment to store Logitech Unifying receiver within the mouse body.And again, shame on Logitech: instead of zoom button they should use a wheel like in previous versions. I think that replacement of the wheel with the button is a badly thought out and badly executed attempt to save a couple of dollars. But sometimes excessive zeal backfires and I think Logitech might feel the pain in this case: Microsoft Wireless Rechargeable Laser Mouse 7000 costs around $25 and is competitive, if you do not value much the bottom button functionality too much (or if you can't adapt to using it, which also can be the case). Battery lasts several months.I would not recommend this mouse at this price range, if you pay your own money. It is overpriced, unreliable/capricious and IMHO should be discounted 50% to, say, $35 to became viable. But on company money this is a very nice mouse and it can speed up several common operations substantially, if you reassign bottom thumb button and zoom button to functions you need most often.So my three stars is for home users. I would probably add a star for corporate users ;-).

I got out the cords and was going to charge it via a USB port while I continued working.  Surprise - the mini connector that goes into the front of the mouse wouldn't fit.  Try as I might, there was no way it would go in.  I went to the Logitech web site and found a number to call them.  The rep answered very soon and was almost understandable to my US ears.

I've used it for one day on my PC at work and the rest of the time at home on my Mac, running OS 10.6 Snow Leopard.  In both Win and Mac OS, i had instant functionality when i plugged in the mouse.  The special buttons don't start working until after you install the Logitech software, but basic point and click stuff works fine, which was nice.Compared to my Apple Mighty Mouse, this thing is nice because it works the instant you turn on the mouse.  No waiting for bluetooth to sync with the computer, etc.  I installed the mouse drivers on both platforms and not surprisingly, they "feel" different.  For example, i like the simplicity and look of the the Mac version of the driver.  There is a BUT here though....  In the Win version, the forward/backward buttons can be easily set as... forward and backward buttons for a browser.  The Mac version has no such default, and i had to tell it to do a keystroke instead, which still accomplishes the same thing.  It's not a huge deal, but a pretty odd omission for something that should be rather obvious.  Not everyone out there knows the keyboard commands for forward/backward.  Wish they made this a bit more foolproof.The feel of the mouse is very good, but i have medium/large hands.  If you have small hands, this mouse will feel huge.  You might consider other Logitech products if that's the case.  It is a very ergonomic shape and i find it comfy.  I love the thumb rest/button.  They got this one right.  It's hard enough to press that it doesn't fire off accidentally, but also doesn't require tons of pressure to activate.  I use it on my Mac to do Expose, but it could be programmed to do anything.  The Windows version of the driver has an Expose-like feature, but it's not nearly as nice as the Mac OS version of it.  Perhaps Windows 7 will have cooler visuals.All in all, the buttons feel pretty good, except for the scroll wheel.  The scrolling is fine, but does seem a bit clunky for a "top shelf" mouse such as this.  It feels clunky and sounds that way, too.  If you need a mouse that scrolls quietly, this isn't it.  My logitech keyboard/mouse combo my work has feels better in the wheel department.  The middle button is what really blows on this mouse.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes i apply moderate pressure to the wheel and the middle button works.  Other times i feel like i'm going to break the mouse to get it to work.  For this reason, i reprogrammed the "zoom" button just below the forward/backward buttons to be my middle button.  I had no use for the zoom, so it works out well.  The zoom button has a great feel.  So, if you just simply can't live with a mouse that has a crappy middle button, you may want to look elsewhere.  Everything else i felt was well put together and seems to work well.  I tend to use the middle button for Google SketchUP, as it's used for panning the 3D model.  It has other uses, which are probably not important to the vast majority of users.  Heck, on a Mac, Apple used to think ONE button was enough on a mouse.  Silly Steve....  I now have 7 buttons and it all works pretty darn well.I think most people will find this mouse very nice and probably worth the cost.  The new "unifying receiver" is just freaking tiny!  The receiver is smaller than the USB plug it's attached to.  It just disappears underneath my aluminum Apple keyboard.  Range on the receiver is good also.  I tested it about 8 feet away and it works flawlessly.  I also tested the mouse on glass.  Yes, it works and works well..

To start with, it comes with a traveling pouch which contains a Micro-USB recharging cable, an USB extension cable, and a wall plug. This gives you the options of charging your mouse from a wall, on a computer near by, or extend to a desktop sitting on the floor. All options allows you to use the mouse while it's being charged so you never have to worry about the mouse suddenly non-operational due to the battery. The full size mouse is very comfortable for me to rest my hand on it. Although I must say, I liked the feel of the MX1100 a little better. I've never used a hyper-scroll wheel before. But it is really great when needing to scroll through very long pages. One other thing I wanted to address is the battery life. I was a little skepitcal on purchasing this mouse initially because of multiple reviews talking about bad battery life. I've charged the mouse to full, had it on the whole time for 6 weeks straight and it is still functioning so far.

The real selling point for me was that since I was also buying the K800 Wireless Back-lit Keyboard as well, the Performance MX was able to sync along the same single Logitech Universal receiver as the keyboard.  The G700 does not use the Universal Reciever that many of the newer Logitech products do.  Being able to free up one USB slot in my machine is always a plus, so I went the Performance MX, and I am just loving it.  Ergonomics was also a huge contributing factor in my decision making as I deal with hand cramps fairly regularly being on the PC a ton (web developer).I cannot speak yet for battery life, but other reviews I had read specified around three - five days of good use.  If I find any less, I will report back, otherwise just assume three days is what you'll get.The cables that come along with the mouse are of exceptional quality, and ergonomic.  The little leather case and USB wall charger was a nice touch too.  For the roughly $75.00 I paid for this mouse, I feel very satisfied with my purchase thus far, and highly recommend the product..

Not a huge problem, and after a couple of days of use one gets accustomed to it.Second, the mouse does not seem to play well when its power is on, but there is no receiver to connect to. There have been a couple of times where I left the mouse on in my bag overnight, and the battery was dead the next morning. This to me is a very minor problem, since I keep hybrid rechargeable AA batteries in my bag anyway, so I can easily swap it out for another 3 weeks or so of hard use (10-12 hours per day at work). I've never had to use the mouse as a "wired" mouse for this reason... and because the battery is so easily replaceable, I don't see why people are so up in arms about this issue.

Everyone at my job laughs at me because I'm always buying a different mouse.  I bought magic mouse from apple (returned that one), I have the standard apple mouse (i hate this mouse), the magic track pad from apple (still got it, don't use it often but it's pretty nice, especially with Lion), a logitech M510 and ended up losing it, so then I got the Logitech M570 (with the trackball) which to date has been my favorite until now.  I just purchased the MX mouse and out of the box that thing was ready to go.  I had to install the control panel software to get all my buttons configured the way I like but once I got it all set up, I was good.  This thing is awesome. The size is perfect, and the buttons are in really good places.  The scroll wheel feels nice and smooth.  The horizontal scroll is a little odd, I keep accidentally clicking down on the scroll wheel but i guess that takes a little time to finess that.  The overall feel of the mouse is good too.  The way it's shaped makes it extremely comfortable.  I'm still not exactly sure what that button behind the scroll wheel is for but whatever, I'm happy with my current configuration.

I loved the feel and I have thumb problems from either rolling Logitech mice or tapping with my Kensington trackball. I used it immediately and loved it. The next day it started double clicking (main reason for giving up the other Logitech tracks). After I calmed down, my brain engaged and I looked at the battery power. It was LOW! I charged it and it went low the following day. (Also note, I don't turn mice off, I've never had to.) So I changed the battery to one of my Imedions. The next day after charging, it was better. The charge seems inconsistent though. Right now it is still showing full after five hours (4:00 p.m.), but by 12:00 a.m. it should be significantly lower. It could also be that on weekends I don't use it as much, so maybe the power management helps to a point. Oh, on mine it seems the double clicking is related to the battery power. In fact, it improved significantly in the trackballs when I inserted fully charged batteries. (I always thought it was because I was laying fingers across the right button and it was interfering, I learned here that that may not be the case.)  Okay, so that is for the battery issue,  I can plug it in EVERY night and it works fine for 24 hours. This is unusual only because I have had Microsoft mice that the battery has lasted forever on a single battery or two. I just remember thinking it had lasted forever.Now the Darkfield Laser Tracking. I thought this would be really cool. To make it easier to scoot around my desk I grabbed an old glass top from a desk that we got rid of. It's huge, I placed it so it ran along side of me because I squirm a lot. It worked great when it was next to me, but had serious issues when it was next to my keyboard (normal mouse placement). I cleaned the glass and cleaned my desk to no avail. It works great directly on my desk, just doesn't slide as easily as I'd like. I seriously do not understand why. I slid a manila folder under the glass and that did not help, so I just got rid of the glass. I also disconnected the other two (which, btw, did not show up in the SetPoint software. I even reinstalled that. They would if I went to 'Open Unifying Software', just not on the drop down menu so I could check their battery power.)I still like it, don't get me wrong, but I just can't give it that five due to the fact that it won't hold a charge very long (and I use a mouse all day long, 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.). I love the idea that I can charge it on my desk when necessary, I just don't think it should be as necessary. I am confused on the power management, 'staying more productive with longer periods between battery changes'. Granted, I may not be changing the batteries so much, but plugging it in kind of defeats my concept of 'wireless.' I am having to charge it every night, which by now you probably have figured I think is excessive. A single charge I'd say lasts about 36 hours or less.Update on June 4, 2013Okay, a couple of people mentioned the "Eneloop" rechargeable batteries. I forgot to plug it in one night, cursed and checked the battery situation.  It still read 'good' maybe fair.  I didn't realize I had replaced the battery with an Eneloop, the last time it went critical on me.  So, maybe they are better.  I still think it should last longer, so I might go experimenting with scouring up another Eneloop and just charge the batteries externally and replace.  I never considered that maybe the mouse wasn't charging properly.  I mean it is "so hard" to pop the back and replace the battery (possible easier then actually plugging the cord in)...  And since I was contemplating buying yet even more rechargeable batteries maybe I'll just get more Eneloops, since I'm running out. We are definitely using more, but I tend to drop them and rechargeables don't bounce well..

I got this mouse after having a G500 for the past 2 years. The g500 is a great mouse, but the mesh around its wire would always tear within the first few months, then the mouse itself would start to lose connection in and out around the 10-12 month mark. The first time they replaced it under warranty, but the 2nd time(for the past 6 weeks) I decided I did not want to buy a new g500 to have the same problem again in a year.The ergonomics are good, I still prefer the feel of the G500 that has a lower arch. The thumb indent on this mouse is great, and makes it easy to use the 3 side buttons, and I've set the 'zoom' button to switch the dpi settings quickly when gaming. The g500 has 3 dpi settings you can change between on the fly, this mouse only has 2, but thats all I need anyway.The tracking has been great, I have no tried it on glass but I have gotten rid of my mouse pad to give a more minimalist look to my work area, it is great having the k800 keyboard and this mouse and no wires aside from my intuos 4 tablet. And only 1 unifying receiver, freeing up a usb port.My favorite thing about this mouse is how it came with a charger that plugs into the outlet. I've had one outlet plug I never really used, but now the wall charger goes in there, and I can place the usb cable in a hidden area, to only be pulled out when charging the mouse or the k800 keyboard. This is great for 2 reasons, I never need to use another usb port to charge these peripherals, and for my office setup, keeps the charging wire hidden while utilizing an outlet that otherwise would not have been used. I also use it to charge my phone now too. This made me realize that all this time I could have just used my phone charger to charge my keyboard before getting this mouse. This is probably just a very specific pro for me, but it is fantastic for keeping a clean desk.The only con I've had with this mouse so far, is that the middle mouse button functions poorly. I never had any problems with my G500 in pressing the middle mouse button to open a link in a new tab, never. With this mouse, when I push down on the middle mouse button it'll often scroll up just a bit, instead of opening the link, or scroll up and open the wrong link. It's extremely annoying and the main reason why I gave this mouse 4 stars instead of 5.Also, the usb cable is rather rigid and was annoying to have plugged into the mouse the first day. Hopefully I always keep the mouse charged well so I never have to actually use the mouse while plugged in..

In reality, its the mouse that needs protecting - why on earth they did not indlude a semi hard shell is beyond me - hence the low rating- many Logitech mice now have a dongle that attaches the mouse to a laptop when moving from office to e.g. a meeting room.  They did not do this for the Performance MX.

Wireless connections are due to all kinds of interference issues, but for me, there was none of that.  Plugged this device into my laptop (which has an older 802.11g connection built in).  It configured quickly, found the 802.11n connection in my house, and kept a solid, speedy connection.  That's pretty much the overview in a nutshell.  Worked great, and isn't terribly expensive.  I loaned out my old 802.11n stick to a friend, who I don't see much anymore, so I kind of needed a new one.  Enter this product.A few details about the setup..In the box is the wireless stick, it has a cover that slides off to expose the USB port, so when you're not using it, you can protect the business end of the thing.  That's useful if this is going to live in a pocket in your gear bag with a bunch of other loose material.  Also in the box is a cable that you can plug the stick into, and then the other end of the cable into your computer.  That's for situations I presume where you need something extra by putting the stick "up high" to minimize interference.  Or you hae a small/recessed port and this doesn't fit.  That's an unnecessary, but nice touch.  Also in there is a CD with software & drivers.  That brings up the biggest point of my review.The CD is one of those tiny ones.  It's not a full sized CD.  I point that out, because I have issues with those in my laptop, they don't always read correctly.  If you have one those drives that doesn't have a recessed portion for a "tiny" CD, this could be an issue for you.  However, the larger issue for me is software. Virtually every stick out there wants to install their own configuration software, when that's completely not necessary.  Windows itself (which is what I use, I can't address Mac or Linux) configures these things quite correctly.  So the first thing I would do is ignore the instruction to install the software.  But you will need the disc for the drivers.Put the disc in your drive, plug in the stick, and when Windows asks to search for drivers, tell it you want to do that manually, and then search the CD for drivers.  That's what I did, it took a minute to configure, but finished.  Then Windows itself can manage the stick, not some additional peiece of software which adds to the overall problem of too many pieces of software on your system.  But honestly, Wireless adapter software isn't necessary to me. Windows handles it fine.That issue aside, the hardware seems good in my testing.  No drops, strong signal, good price.

I tried two USB adapters, only one of which was able to reach the network I'm trying to connect to, and then not very reliably. This adapter maintains a consistent connection with 40-60% signal strength (which is good enough given the circumstances). It comes with a USB extension that lets you place it in a few different places for better reception. Installation was fairly easy, the drivers come on a mini CD (or DVD?) and install without too much hassle. The external antenna means better signal strength and upgradability (perhaps), which is a plus for me. Also, it works with Linux without any extra drivers which is great. At a great price + Prime shipping I'd give it a go if you need a better network adapter.My minor complaint is that I had to do a good bit of positioning to get the strength I'm getting. I actually have two USB extension cords that let me place this thing on top of my desk. While I understand you can't work miracles for less than twenty bucks I wish I could just leave it plugged into the back of my tower. One other minor complaint is that the wifi utility (which works much better with this than Windows' default) doesn't work too well with fullscreen applications. Netflix/YouTube videos drop out of fullscreen very frequently, and fullscreen games will minimize likewise. In order to play any sort of game I had to exit the utility in the taskbar, which isn't a huge deal once you're already connected.Including the two minor issues above, I hesitated give it 5 stars because whoever was responsible for tendering the package to FedEx did not hand it over for over 24 hours. I ordered one-day shipping on a Thursday afternoon and, because FedEx doesn't normally ship on Saturdays, didn't get my order until Monday. This was either a major oversight or excessive laziness, but support was friendly and refunded my shipping costs (only $4 with Prime, I suppose) so I'm not turning tail on Amazon anytime soon. Plus an adapter like this for $20? I'd wait a full month for shipping..

No muss no fuss.As I also have a wired Ethernet Internet connection I tried out the softAP mode, which if you're unfamiliar with, allows you take an existing wired internet connection and create a quick access point to allow surrounding wireless devices to share that connection.

You can set security options for added safety and it's so easy to set up.So within literally seconds I was up and running. This is using aging now MS windows XP Pro too fwiw.

I have installed all patches for both desktop and laptop to make sure any known issue fixes for Win 7 have been installed.  Following the directions in the quick guide, I inserted the adaptor first, then inserted the CD, did whatever as prompted to install the driver, but the adaptor could not find any wireless network at my home or in my community.  I also tried to let Windows Update find driver, or install the driver first and insert the adaptor secondly, or manually point to the driver file from the device property, but no luck.  I also tried to download the driver from TP-Link website since normally the website has the latest driver.  I also tried to turn off my firewall just in case.  I tried to uninstall and re-install driver to make sure a clean version doesn't mess up.  I also tried to install it on my laptop, because sometimes one computer has problem, the other may not, but it turns out to be the same issue.  I have tried as many measures as I can think of.  But the driver just couldn't make this adaptor work, it just flashes with a green light at a frequency of one flash per second.  For now I can conclude that the driver for this adaptor just doesn't work for Windows 7 64-bit.  For those users with a Windows 7 64-bit OS, be cautious, you may need to find something else.I purchased this product after reading so many positive reviews but most reviews just lack of information on what their system is.

It's sleek, smooth, and has cool proportions. Even the underside looks slick.This being said, there's still room for improvement, both style- and function-wise. The shortness (height, not length) of it takes some getting used to, though it's not terribly difficult to do so. Because of the touch-sensitive capability, I feel like I can't rest my hand on it, and the aforementioned low altitude makes holding my hand higher a bit annoying.Moving on to functionality, it does everything you'd expect in a normal mouse. You can scroll (because this is simply moving your finger around on a surface, you can scroll much farther before needing to return to the other side of the mouse!), left- and right-click, and move the cursor.Overall, I'd say this was a good purchase, but I'd really like more gestures and/or buttons (probably these would simply be activated by pressing the side, with no visible button, but I just want more functionality.).

It was at my school bookstore and I just bought it on impulse.  This is not a terrible mouse, but it is NOT WORTH $70.  Please, what a rip-off!  Most of the $70 is contributed to having the "official" Apple logo on the mouse.  It's a great sale to someone in an Apple store who knows nothing about mice or doesn't care about money, but if you are a savvy shopper (which I wasn't this time), then keep in mind that the high price tag is due to the logo and the image that comes with it, not from being anything special.The main thing I see people complain about is the ergodynamics of it.  It actually works well for me because I have teeny tiny hands, but my boyfriend has big hands and hates this mouse and won't even use it.  You need to feel this mouse and test it out before buying it.  They have plenty at any Apple store.PROS+It fits nice in your hand if you have small hands+It's bluetooth connected and will automatically shut-off if it's not being used, which is pretty cool and unique for a mouse+Once you get used to it, it's pretty easy to scroll and move forward and backward in browsers with the "two finger" feature+It looks stylish and "official" with the Apple logo, if you care about the whole image thing.CONS-It's terrible for someone with big hands.  The flatness of it just doesn't work.-It's SEVENTY DOLLARS!!!  For a mouse!!-It really doesn't stand out as doing anything special-Doesn't work with Windows-Sort of difficult to scroll with acrylic nails-The clicking is LOUD!!I have been through tons of mice.  I highly recommend any of theLogitech M305 Wireless Mouse (Black).  They have lots of colors, have an elevated style that fits all hand sizes, works with Windows and Apple, and is a fraction of the price and works just as well, if not better (lost three of them though).If you are into the flat design, I also bought (and lost)Cosmos  Red 2.4G RF optical wireless USB mouse for macbook 13" PRO AIR 11" DELL ACER SONY HP TOSHIBA+ Cosmos cable tiefor $9.99.  It feels almost identical to the Magic mouse, except it doesn't have the "magical" functions, like scrolling without a scroll tab and it's USB wireless, not bluetooth.  It looks super sleek and elegant though.  But I notice that the Cosmos also shuts off without use, which the Logitech does NOT do.  If you forget to turn off your Logitech mouse the battery will drain like crazy.Another thing is all the flat mouses have the loudest clicking sounds ever.  The logitech is much more quiet, especially after some use.  I hate being in a classroom and feeling like everyone is hearing me click, click, click!!!  Get the Logitech if you want quiet.I like it....and would give it 4 stars if it were $40, but $70????  Get something for $10-$25 that's identical in quality or better..

The battery life is unimpressive.I recently switched to a different  mouse on my main computer, and I instantly realized that the awkward shape of the Magic Mouse was causing discomfort in my shoulder and wrist. Because of the very flat shape of the mouse, you either have to position the mouse farther away than normal (not an option on my desk), or hold your hand an awkward angle so that your index finger lands on the virtual scroll wheel.To its credit, the mouse has never un-paired from my Mac in nearly four years of use, and it is a very attractive device. So I'll give it a 10 for form and 3 for function..

Ergonomically, it is not ideal for those, including myself, who are accustomed to the right click button used in PC mouses.I agree, for the most part, with the reviews that mention how sleek and quick it can be with the Mac software. As a Macbook Pro with Retina Display owner, the Magic Mouse is a rather lovely accessory (again, it is visually attractive). It is quite a device if you are in iOS and are going from one webpage to the next or from one website to another. Despite this flashy feature, it does not, IMHO, equal the natural feel and comfort of what one would expect from an expensive mouse.I do not possess the Windows 8 for Mac software manufactured by Microsoft; instead, I have the Parallels Desktop version of Windows 8 installed in my Macbook Pro. For anyone else who has this product, here is a word of warning. With this software, as well as the Office 2010, which I purchased from Microsoft and have imbedded inside, the Magic Mouse falls short on versatility. In this PC universe of my iOS device, you cannot use the right click substitution with the Magic Mouse. What you will essentially have in this domain is what might as well be a mouse with only the left click button operable.So if you are going to use both Mac and PC programs with your computer or laptop or whatever device, I say get a very good Logitech wireless mouse for about half the price..

Both Mac and Windows users have complained endlessly about Apple mouses for years and years, but my two favourite mouses are Apple-made. My first favourite is the Mighty Mouse (which was almost perfect), and my second favourite (which will probably tell you even more about me) is the hockey puck that came with the original iMacs. In general i prefer small, simple, ambidextrous mouses -- i hate those big hardcore Logitech and Microsoft ones that gamers use, for example. So, anyway, you should probably read my review with all that in mind.When the Magic Mouse first came out, i liked where they were going, but was ultimately disappointed for two reasons: (1) no middle-click and (2) no Expos&eacute; button. Since i spend the vast majority of my computer time in a Web browser, middle-click is very important to me. It wasn't until my wired Mighty Mouse's scroll ball died (again) and third-party Magic Mouse utilities were mature that i decided to go for the Magic Mouse -- so i'm pretty late to get mine.The first thing i did of course was install BetterTouchTool, because Apple's preference utility, whilst adequate for most basic users, is no-where near configurable enough for my liking. Using BTT i was able to add middle-click functionality (so far i'm leaning toward the 'Two Finger TipTap Middle' gesture as my preferred middle-click method, but it also lets you set a physical middle-click similar to the Mighty Mouse), as well as an Expos&eacute; gesture.Having that in place, i was able to start using the mouse 'normally', and these are my observations:PROS- It's much lighter than the Mighty Mouse -- or at least it feels that way, i haven't actually weighed it or anything. This is a pretty big deal to me, because, having gone from the wired Mighty Mouse to the wireless one, i found the added weight of the latter to be very fatiguing to my hand.- Turning the mouse on and off is far easier than it is on the wireless Mighty Mouse. On the latter, you have to move a switch that covers the laser -- this switch is mostly flush with the bottom, which makes it hard to get traction, and it's very difficult to move on top of that. As a result i've found turning the Mighty Mouse on/off to be extremely tedious. The new mouse is not like that -- the switch on the bottom is super easy to toggle.- The tracking is fantastic. My primary complaint with the wireless Mighty Mouse was that its tracking felt wrong somehow in comparison to the wired one. A test i used to determine this was to attempt drawing a perfect circle on the screen with each mouse. On the wired mouse -- and the Magic Mouse -- drawing a round circle is no problem at all. On the wireless Mighty Mouse, the tracking just didn't work as well, which resulted in a circle that was always flattened.- No more scroll ball to clean! I really liked having a physical scroll ball on the Mighty Mouse, but it needed constant maintenance to keep it working properly. The scrolling on the Magic Mouse is almost perfect (i do miss having full 360-degree scrolling, but it's not that bad), and there are no moving parts to deal with.- The basic features function exactly as expected. I never have any issues with right-clicks being detected as left-clicks or vice versa, and as mentioned the scrolling works great. BetterTouchTool's added features do present a tiny bit more of a challenge, because certain gestures can be interpreted differently, but you just have to use the right ones.CONS- Obviously a major con is that you have fewer buttons out of the box than the Mighty Mouse had. You'll need BetterTouchTool or MagicPrefs if you want a middle-click.- Related to the above, it takes a little bit of getting used to before you can comfortably use the added features provided by BTT. The learning curve is no-where near as easy as the Mighty Mouse's.- As far as i can tell, it's not possible to run the Magic Mouse on only one battery, as it was with the wireless Mighty Mouse. It's too bad, because i really value lightness in a mouse.- The profile of the Mighty Mouse, as mentioned in other reviews, is very low. It's probably the lowest mouse i've ever used. On the one hand, this helps to prevent accidental triggering of the touch gestures, but on the other hand it is very difficult to get used to, and is noticeably more fatiguing to the hand than either Mighty Mouse was. I would have been willing to accept the added weight if they had made the mouse like 5 mm taller.- As with the Mighty Mouse, the Magic Mouse is not intended for gamers. Although it is possible to do some interesting things with BetterTouchTool, including assigning macros or hot keys to mouse gestures, i think you will have more problems overall if you're playing fast-paced games. A common complaint is accidental scrolling, which causes the weapons to change in an FPS.- Lastly, on a related note to the above, the mouse is currently not very fun to use on Windows or Linux, since Apple don't provide full-featured drivers for those systems. Maybe someone will write their own though.Overall i do like it; my main complaints are the height of the mouse (which is too low) and the weight of the mouse (which is still too heavy -- but this is an inherent problem with all wireless mouses).edited 2010/09/04:I've been using the mouse a few more days now and i've found or confirmed a few flaws:1. The low profile is indeed more fatiguing. I think it's becoming easier to deal with as i use it more, but the first day of use resulted in some hardcore wrist pain :/2. I've found middle-click a little more difficult than i first realised. The lack of a physical scroll ball makes it hard to put your finger in the right spot for a physical middle-click, so i've had to improvise, as mentioned in the third paragraph up at the top of this review. This works, but it requires a fair bit of concentration; it's no longer effortless like middle-clicking on the Mighty Mouse was.3. Another major issue is scrolling. I mentioned before that the gesture detection is very accurate -- unfortunately when it comes to scrolling (or 'swiping'), it's TOO accurate. There is very little, if any, 'accidental scrolling detection'. The problem with this is that the very very slight natural movements of the finger tips that occur when my hand is resting on the mouse are detected as scroll gestures, and as a result documents and Web pages constantly jitter up and down by a few pixels when i'm reading them. This is very irritating as you can imagine, and there doesn't seem to be a way to change the sensitivity, even within BTT.As a result i've downgraded my score from 4/5 to 3/5.I think my dream mouse would be a Mighty Mouse with the following modifications:- (partially) aluminium, instead of all plastic- bottom 'chassis' identical to the one on the Magic Mouse (including laser, battery cover, and on/off switch)- improved tracking- optical scroll ball instead of a mechanical one -- with 'accident' detection and adjustable sensitivityFor now i will be stuck between the two :(.

Of course, if you have both your fingers on the mouse, it registers as a left click.  So you have to lift your index finger before pressing the right side of the mouse.  in addition, doing spreadsheet work is cumbersome as the slightest bit of contact with the surface of the mouse will move the spreadsheet up and down, left and right.  Navigating browsers can be difficult as well.  The page moves back and forth from any accidental touches.  You can, of course, turn that feature off.  but, that would make the point of this mouse moot.  As such, it's not a horrible mouse.  It's just OK.Update: Battery life is atrocious.  I've used my mouse for 5 months and I've had to replace my batteries 4 times already.  In contrast, I haven't had to replace my keyboard batteries during the same period of time..

This is a product that is of fantastic and simple design and is easy to use.  I opened the mouse when it arrived from Amazon, turned a switch on, and it then worked immediately and just as advertised.  This is how a product "experience" should unfold, yet I find such an unfolding increasingly infrequent with technology products.  Kudos to Apple for making this product work so well.The most impressive feature with this mouse is the multi-touch surface.  I find myself scrolling with a mouse more and more frequently, and the Apple Magic Mouse makes the scrolling experience smooth, easy, and nearly effortless.  Most other mice use some type of "roller" for scrolling functionality -- this mouse senses your touch and can even apply "momentum" to the direction and acceleration of your finger movements.Apple Magic Mouse seems to "know" what you want the cursor to do.  It makes the interface experience notably better as compared to all other input devices that I have used.  I highly recommend the Apple Magic Mouse.Arther C.

I like the grippy rubber sides and rubber scroll wheel that clicks. This unit has that untangilble something about the entire feel and experience that says- NICE!So on the negative side, too bad you have to download the software to program this with additional functionality. Not a huge deal, nor that time consuming and worth it for the extra features that can be added, like tilting the scroll wheel to move forward and backward in the web browser, for example.For basic mouse functions, it was a super-fast case of plug and play with Vista.

The scroll wheel used as a button.When pressing the left or right button, you get a solid click and the action takes place.The scroll wheel works great too (as a scroll wheel).BUT - If you use the scroll wheel as a button (middle mouse) to open a link in a new tab (Firefox, IE, etc.), the mouse fails.  Well it doesn't quite fail: The problem is that half the time there is a click and you stop, thinking that was enough and the new tab should open.  It turns out that isn't always the case.  Sometimes when the middle button is pressed, you have to press past the click until you feel and hear a second click.  But this is not a double click like you do to open a program, but a double click with a single press.When this happens, like I said about half the time, the link doesn't open until the "second" click.It is very frustrating not knowing if you have pressed "hard" enough until it doesn't work and  have to press again.I've tried two of these mice and they behaved exactly the same, the scroll wheel as a middle mouse button is just not reliable.I am now trying a Microsoft 3500 mouse.

The mouse worked just fine.Then I found a solution that boggles me: I plugged the little receiver into a USB hub, rather than directly into my laptop. The problem vanished. Here's where it gets better: when using the laptop alone (without a hub attached) I can use the mouse without any problems, the receiver plugged directly into the laptop. When I use it with an external monitor and connect a bunch of USB devices via a hub, the receiver has to be plugged into the hub (not the laptop) or I get major tracking issues.My unscientific conclusion is that there's some sort of interference through my laptop's USB port (15" MacBook Pro) or that plugging in a hub makes the non-hub USB port a bit inconsistent in its data stream, causing the jumpiness..

Then a friend picked up one of these from Logitech, and this reviewer saw that many improvements had been made in the technology, enough to consider one as a viable option.Bought a newApple MacBook Prorecently for use when configuring a network in support of a client, and though the touchpad on the notebook was very good, still wanted the functionality of a decent mouse. Picked up aLogitech M305 Wireless Mousein silver, the closest match to the MacBook Pro's aluminum frame. Inserted the AA battery in the mouse unit, plugged the nano-receiver into one of the USB ports, and MacBook found it immediately.Was immediately impressed by the overall quality, and was pleasantly surprised to find just how ergonomic this mouse is, from the tactile feel of the left and right buttons to the smooth scroll wheel. There are soft rubber grips on each side, and the contoured shape feels quite comfortable in the hand.The supplied AA battery lasted for about six weeks before replacement was needed, and though some have gotten even better life, have no complaints at all, as that sounds quite reasonable. It goes into automatic sleep mode and turns the mouse off when its not in use, and there's a power indicator light when the mouse is activated after not being used for awhile.Had also considered the beautiful and stylishApple Magic Mousewhen trying to decide which mouse to go with. Really do like Apple's design, along with it's look and feel, but could buy two of the Logitech mouse units for less than the price of the Apple mouse... which is exactly what I did: picked up aLogitech Wireless Mouse M305 in blackfor use with my notebook PC running Windows 7.And here's the interesting point for those running two computers: there is no conflict between the mouse units, no false signals to the wrong computer even when both are running in close questers. This was a concern that I had based on prior experience with wireless mouse units, and is something that the Logitech engineers have managed to overcome.This is a 5-star product in all respects, and can be recommended to anyone desiring a small, compact and ergonomic mouse unit that just keeps working the way one might hope..

It slids smoothly and quietly on almost any surface with no mechanical noises or plastic creaking.

If needed, it fits in the bottom of the mouse when not in use.Operationally, the 3500 mouse uses a blue LED for tracking. It tracks well on any surface including my bare desktop and even on the sofa arm rest. The pointer does move a little faster than the wired mouse I replaced, but it was easily adjustable in the windows control panel. Tracking is precise and there is no detectible pointer lag. The wheel is detented so it doesn't move until you want it to. The buttons click with authority, but not too loud. I've used two of these mice for two years and never had a problem with either one.

Between the button barely depressing when pressed and hardly making any sound, I find myself looking up to check if a new tab has actually opened, which it always has. I'm sure I'll get used to it and trust that it's working. That feature is one that was malfunctioning with my previous mouse so I'm a little gun shy right now.I did not download the software that it comes packaged with. The drivers downloaded automatically and it worked without much ado. I honestly don't notice any difference with the BlueTrack technology and cannot speak for battery longevity yet.In case it helps anybody, I was having problems with my old mouse behaving erratically, single clicks acting like I had double-clicked, impossible to highlight and drag anything, etc. The problems would come and go. I tried two different mice, a cordless and a wired and both had the same problems.

Ordered yesterday - here today!  That's at least twice as fast as I expected as a Prime member, and we've got a blizzard sweeping across America at the moment.  Most impressive!As for the mouse . . . I was replacing a Logitech 510 that (as had happened with an earlier 510 of mine) lost its ability to speed-scroll when depressing the wheel and dragging the mouse forward or back across the desktop, allowing blazing movement across large documents.  Alas, it must be a proprietary function to Logitech, as it's not available on this MS 3500 mouse.But Microsoft's accompanying software makes up for that functional goody by permitting a much finer tuning of the scroll function (speed & jump distance) than available in the Win 7 O/S alone.  Also, pressing the MS 3500 wheel allows instant tab jumps -- much quicker than the old, Alt + Tab keys method.  Lastly . . . its smaller footprint takes up slightly less desk space and the price is noticeably better that a comparable Logitech mouse.  All combined . . . it's worth five stars!.

Unlike a Logitech mouse, the cursor speed is the same as most other mice, & the speed slider adjustment is right in the middle; giving most users plenty of adjustment either way.
